Now, this one time, I said 'Yes' on two conditions. First, a portion of the proceeds had to go to charity. Second, I wanted to kidnap Fred Savage. The second condition took some explaining...\"\n\nFred Savage will join Reynolds in new scenes for ONCE UPON A DEADPOOL in an homage to Savage's starring role in the 1987 bedtime-story classic THE PRINCESS BRIDE. Fred remarked, “while my participation in this film was anything but voluntary, I am happy to learn that Fudge Cancer will be the beneficiary of this shameless cash grab”\n\nFor every ticket sold, $1 will go to the charity Fudge Cancer - previously known as Fuck Cancer, who have graciously changed their name to be more PG-13 friendly for the 12 days of Once Upon A Deadpool’s release.\n\n#OnceUponADeadpool\n\nConnect with Deadpool Online: https://fox.co/OnceUponADeadpoolMovie...\nLike Deadpool on FACEBOOK: http://fox.co/DeadpoolFB\nFollow Deadpool on TWITTER: http://fox.co/DeadpoolTwitter\nFollow Deadpool on INSTAGRAM: http://fox.co/DeadpoolInstagram","views":5757035,"likes":168558,"dislikes":3765,"channel_name":"20th Century Fox","channel_id":"UC2-BeLxzUBSs0uSrmzWhJuQ","day":1,"date":19,"month":10,"year":2018,"transcript":[[[0,0],"-(Holiday music) -Right before Christmas,"],[[0,2],"a good guy in red, is coming to theaters,"],[[0,5],"with his new sidekick, Fred."],[[0,12],"Why am I here?!"],[[0,14],"You're in a PG-13 version of Deadpool,"],[[0,16],"filtered through the prism of child like innocence."],[[0,19],"-I'm a grown man! -And nobody does child like"],[[0,21],"innocence like you Fred!

close"],[[4,12],"that being said 6.8 I got again I'm"],[[4,14],"hovering in that nine point five to ten"],[[4,17],"again I think I'm really proud of my"],[[4,19],"effort I think that the person who

rib"],[[4,45],"bone so I had to use the little vegan"],[[4,47],"rib bones that you put in like cocktails"],[[4,49],"at fancy restaurants the bad ones oh"],[[4,51],"yeah this is Satan Satan yeah mm-hmm"],[[4,59],"this is seitan and I'm just gonna"],[[5,1],"disregard what you said right there"],[[5,2],"this is seitan it's I believe 100% wheat"],[[5,5],"gluten wheat gluten wheat gluten but it"],[[5,8],"is so wheat glutinous that it wouldn't"],[[5,10],"fit on the popsicle stick something to"],[[5,13],"put it on a toothpick this so far tastes"],[[5,14],"the most like beef as I recall it's been"],[[5,17],"months of this you know it's not bad"],[[5,22],"what do you thinking as far as in a"],[[5,24],"radius score hmm I'm gonna go with the"],[[5,28],"gentleman's six point seven six point"],[[5,32],"seven yeah I'm gonna go nine point six"],[[5,34],"of ten point one well I mean I think"],[[5,35],"that really this nails a flavor of beef"],[[5,37],"it does kinda look good yeah this

to give them"],[[1,56],"some sort of back support so that they"],[[1,58],"don't get fatigued and tired and start"],[[2,0],"slouching because if they are to slouch"],[[2,2],"when they get tired and they obviously"],[[2,4],"will get tired they can do more internal"],[[2,6],"damage with that poll going through them"],[[2,7],"Oh drunk go get yourself a banana bag IV"],[[2,11],"put it in your arm and then find me do"],[[2,13],"not speak to any more patients do not"],[[2,15],"practice any medicine IV drips do not"],[[2,18],"stop hangovers this is why so many"],[[2,20],"people are opening these IV drip spas"],[[2,23],"especially in Vegas I see that happen a"],[[2,25],"lot and they promise you that it's gonna"],[[2,26],"block or cure your hangover and IV will"],[[2,29],"hydrate you the same that you can"],[[2,32],"hydrate yourself by drinking some water"],[[2,35],"or drinking some fluids with"],[[2,36],"electrolytes in them now that being said"],[[2,38],"it's gonna be a little bit quicker but"],[[2,39],"then again you're also increasing risks"],[[2,41],"because you're opening a hole in your"],[[2,44],"skin to get that IV in some things I"],[[2,45],"mentioned about hangovers is that it's"],[[2,47],"not all about dehydration a hangover is"],[[2,50],"like a catch-all term for all sorts of"],[[2,52],"symptoms nausea vomiting fatigue"],[[2,54],"dizziness a dry mouth"],[[2,57],"yes hydration may help some of these"],[[2,59],"things but it's a complicated process"],[[3,0],"that has a lot of things going on in it"],[[3,2],"just giving yourself hydration is not"],[[3,4],"the sole answer oh yeah some redneck"],[[3,8],"tried to outrun the train hunting the"],[[3,10],"train slammed into his ass and then it"],[[3,11],"rolled her oh no no no no no dude this"],[[3,15],"toast he's doing sutures it look like"],[[3,18],"above her eyebrow no doctor would"],[[3,20],"perform sutures like that keeping your"],[[3,22],"hands elevated like that from a lowered"],[[3,24],"position and doing sutures you're gonna"],[[3,26],"get fatigued so quickly and your hands"],[[3,28],"are gonna start shaking and you won't be"],[[3,30],"able to do it right you always need to"],[[3,31],"be above the given situation way to go"],[[3,34],"I'm taking your friend for an x-ray no"],[[3,37],"offense no boy but you look like my"],[[3,39],"oldest son he's nothing but trouble"],[[3,41],"Yvonne shut up what I said no I'm just"],[[3,44],"saying are you sure you're a doctor I"],[[3,46],"get that all the time you doing trying"],[[3,50],"to insert my banana bag which sounds"],[[3,52],"vaguely dirty but it is a banana bag is"],[[3,55],"just an IV bag with normal saline which"],[[3,57],"is fluids with electrolytes in them"],[[3,59],"there's also some vitamins in there"],[[4,0],"generally this is given to people who"],[[4,2],"are chronic alcoholics because they're"],[[4,4],"usually a nutrient depleted giving it a"],[[4,6],"banana bag to someone who's healthy and"],[[4,8],"had a few drinks pretty much useless"],[[4,11],"just have some water and give it some"],[[4,13],"time his legs what about them"],[[4,15],"[Music]"],[[4,17],"they're both left fine the man's leg"],[[4,25],"yang find it yes sir"],[[4,27],"they got the wrong leg and why did she"],[[4,31],"say it only then these people are still"],[[4,34],"alive they're still making small talk"],[[4,36],"pose tamponade in the wound as far as we"],[[4,39],"can see when she says that the wound is"],[[4,41],"being tamponade it by a pole it means"],[[4,45],"that it's exerting pressure and actually"],[[4,46],"preventing them from bleeding that's why"],[[4,49],"if you ever get stabbed with something"],[[4,51],"it's never ideal to just pull it out"],[[4,52],"automatically until you have medical"],[[4,54],"care that object whatever it is it's"],[[4,57],"putting pressure to stop the bleeding"],[[4,59],"what if we move one of the patients off"],[[5,1],"the pole to get the saw in there then we"],[[5,4],"can hold a pulse steady in the other"],[[5,6],"love it very slowly and repair the"],[[5,9],"damage as we go who which would you move"],[[5,13],"with her injuries her chances of"],[[5,17],"survival are extremely slim no matter"],[[5,19],"what we do I don't really buy the"],[[5,20],"realism of this the Horta is a pulsatile"],[[5,23],"vessel meaning that every time the heart"],[[5,26],"beats they are two moves so if you have"],[[5,28],"a metal pole that's going through the"],[[5,30],"aorta and it's cut it open there's no"],[[5,33],"way that pole is putting that much"],[[5,34],"pressure that it's preventing her from"],[[5,36],"bleeding out unless it's like crushing"],[[5,38],"it or compressing it in such a weird way"],[[5,40],"so basically whoever you move doesn't"],[[5,42],"stand a chance why can't they just cut"],[[5,46],"the pole from in between them and then"],[[5,47],"separate them how do you choose how do"],[[5,50],"you decide who gets to live near a cute"],[[5,53],"doctor can't doctors get to call me by"],[[5,55],"my first name"],[[5,57],"Bonnie Oh McDreamy can you feel me"],[[6,4],"rubbing your foot could you try to"],[[6,6],"wiggle your toes mr. Maynard no they"],[[6,10],"move it yes they are good that's good"],[[6,14],"right yes it is this is what about me"],[[6,17],"my movement"],[[6,21],"yes that's probably one of the"],[[6,27],"situations it's okay to lie to my"],[[6,28],"patient is there any chance that we can"],[[6,30],"get out of here sometime this year well"],[[6,33],"the labs back topped and so is radiology"],[[6,35],"and I can't discharge your friend until"],[[6,36],"I'm certain she doesn't have any"],[[6,37],"internal injuries"],[[6,39],"nowadays we decide if someone has"],[[6,42],"internal bleeding with an ultrasound"],[[6,43],"called the fast scan if I don't find"],[[6,45],"this leg the chief is gonna cut me from"],[[6,47],"this program and I cannot go back home"],[[6,48],"Burke it is too sunny in Los Angeles"],[[6,50],"it's sunny every day I don't understand"],[[6,53],"what she expect does she think that the"],[[6,55],"the chief is gonna be like you couldn't"],[[6,56],"find this leg in the rubble so that's it"],[[6,59],"you're cut from the program I don't"],[[7,0],"understand what her thinking is this"],[[7,1],"supposed to make a comedic aspect that"],[[7,3],"she being sarcastic in order to operate"],[[7,5],"on mr. Maynard we have to separate you"],[[7,7],"two in order to do that we have to move"],[[7,12],"you backwards off the pole"],[[7,13],"[Music]"],[[7,15],"can I just pull the pole out of both of"],[[7,17],"us well if we did that you would both"],[[7,20],"start bleeding very quickly too quickly"],[[7,22],"right now the pole is plugging the"],[[7,25],"whoops was removed the organs will shift"],[[7,29],"and there's a great deal of damage so if"],[[7,36],"you move me Oh"],[[7,38],"die you're being ridiculous you're gonna"],[[7,43],"be fine do you hear me I hear you but we"],[[7,45],"still have to sign the forms"],[[7,47],"unless you want our son to end up with"],[[7,49],"my mom all of you you been together"],[[7,57],"since third grade"],[[7,58],"oh we're not lovers we're best friends"],[[8,2],"oh we just wanted our kids to out to"],[[8,4],"parents so we got a sperm donor the same"],[[8,8],"donor so your babies are brother and"],[[8,10],"sister"],[[8,11],"oh how cool is that oh my gosh who"],[[8,15],"writes this stuff you bought us your"],[[8,20],"phone Yvonne Yvonne"],[[8,24],"[Applause]"],[[8,26],"Evon looks like she passed out okay"],[[8,30],"first thing you do during your code blue"],[[8,31],"chest compressions chest compression"],[[8,33],"chest compression chest compression but"],[[8,35],"also before you cope call a code blue"],[[8,38],"you got a check for a pulse"],[[8,39],"because code blue means someone's heart"],[[8,41],"has stopped and just because someone's"],[[8,42],"unconscious it doesn't mean they're a"],[[8,44],"code blue so my man needed to go right"],[[8,46],"up there to the carotid or to the"],[[8,48],"femoral artery or to the radial artery"],[[8,50],"this is usually the best place and feel"],[[8,52],"if there's a pulse if there's no pulse"],[[8,53],"yelling for help while doing chest"],[[8,56],"compressions she's lost too much blood"],[[8,57],"she's been bleeding for hours"],[[8,59],"there's no blood she's not bleeding she"],[[9,1],"was bleeding internally what's"],[[9,2],"interesting about the abdominal cavity"],[[9,4],"is that the back portion the posterior"],[[9,6],"portion which we call the"],[[9,8],"retroperitoneal area it could actually"],[[9,10],"store a lot of blood so you can be"],[[9,13],"having a very slow leak of blood into"],[[9,15],"that area and not really know that"],[[9,17],"you're bleeding out the one thing that"],[[9,18],"makes this less likely is that she was"],[[9,20],"talking she was moving around generally"],[[9,22],"if you're losing blood you start having"],[[9,24],"symptoms like you feel fatigued your"],[[9,26],"eyes are closing you feel like you're"],[[9,27],"gonna faint or pass out your blood"],[[9,29],"pressure starts dropping you can even be"],[[9,32],"having some abdominal pain because blood"],[[9,34],"is a natural irritant to the abdominal"],[[9,36],"cavity so you start feeling pain and"],[[9,39],"then once we do our exam we'll note that"],[[9,41],"you have an acute abdomen we would do an"],[[9,42],"ultrasound or a cat scan find the"],[[9,44],"bleeding and then take you in for what"],[[9,46],"we call an explorative laparotomy where"],[[9,48],"we literally open up your stomach"],[[9,50],"by stomach I mean the skin of your"],[[9,52],"abdomen look around check the entire"],[[9,54],"intestines find where you're bleeding"],[[9,56],"fix that area put everything back in so"],[[9,59],"you back up and get you up and moving"],[[10,1],"again but in this case she's lost so"],[[10,3],"much blood that she went to cardiac"],[[10,4],"arrest"],[[10,5],"meaning her heart stopped now he's doing"],[[10,7],"the advanced cardiac life support"],[[10,9],"procedure where he's giving up a nephron"],[[10,11],"he's doing chest compressions he's"],[[10,13],"helping her breathe with the bag and"],[[10,16],"hopefully try to get her pulse back and"],[[10,18],"get her heart beating again"],[[10,22],"[Music]"],[[10,24],"time of death 251"],[[10,28],"[Music]"],[[10,39],"Meredith dr. gray very the booster we"],[[10,46],"have an obligation"],[[10,52],"too much damage it was never anything do"],[[10,55],"we have to let her go"],[[10,56],"[Music]"],[[11,1],"time of death 349 one of the most"],[[11,3],"difficult parts about medicine is triage"],[[11,5],"knowing who you can help in a given"],[[11,7],"moment and knowing where to use"],[[11,10],"resources when they're very limited some"],[[11,12],"of those decisions are heart wrenching"],[[11,14],"they're incredibly difficult to make at"],[[11,17],"times it feels like you're playing God"],[[11,19],"and it's putting you the most unfair"],[[11,21],"situations but you have to do your best"],[[11,24],"given what limited resources you have"],[[11,26],"and what limited information you have to"],[[11,28],"make the best possible and fairest"],[[11,30],"decision I applaud all first responders"],[[11,33],"in these types of mass casualty"],[[11,35],"situations growing up in New York City"],[[11,38],"thinking about 911 what that must have"],[[11,41],"been like for people who were working in"],[[11,44],"the local New York City hospitals it"],[[11,47],"scares me it blows my mind all at the"],[[11,49],"same time I've trained in level 1 trauma"],[[11,52],"centers during my medical school time"],[[11,55],"and just having a few people come in"],[[11,58],"with gunshot wounds or knife wounds or"],[[11,59],"bicycle accidents those are incredibly"],[[12,3],"stressful situations you never know what"],[[12,5],"to expect you always have to be thinking"],[[12,6],"quickly on your feet so then to imagine"],[[12,9],"what it must be like when hundreds of"],[[12,10],"people or even thousands of people are"],[[12,12],"coming in Wow"],[[12,13],"so huge thank you to all the people that"],[[12,15],"are have ever been involved or may ever"],[[12,17],"be involved in those types of situations"],[[12,19],"in the future we really respect you and"],[[12,21],"thank you for your service it suffers no"],[[12,26],"again these conversations don't happen"],[[12,29],"in the open this is not right"],[[12,30],"better get cleaned up"],[[12,32],"Brown's five minutes"],[[12,36],"today's been"],[[12,39],"I don't get it they work 30 hours they"],[[12,41],"come in for an emergency look look like"],[[12,43],"they worked for another 12 hours they've"],[[12,45],"been working for 42 now they're going to"],[[12,47],"morning rounds do they ever get time oh"],[[12,50],"oh man you guys recommend that a doozy"],[[12,52],"here it presented an interesting"],[[12,54],"situation unfortunate for the patient"],[[12,57],"that died kind of shows you that doctors"],[[12,59],"are sometimes put into really tight"],[[13,1],"spots where they have to use limited"],[[13,3],"information limited resources and"],[[13,4],"sometimes let one life go in order to"],[[13,7],"save another and that's a very very very"],[[13,10],"unfair and tight situation that we find"],[[13,12],"ourselves in that's what we asked for"],[[13,13],"when we decided to go into medicine and"],[[13,15],"that's why it's a beautiful field and we"],[[13,17],"get so much admiration put upon us as"],[[13,19],"doctors because we have to make those"],[[13,21],"decisions"],[[13,22],"I like Grey's Anatomy it's a fun show"],[[13,24],"there's a lot of drama in it so if

got"],[[1,16],"everything about as close as we can get"],[[1,18],"so it's time to get started"],[[1,19],"first step let's get some charcoal"],[[1,21],"burning we're gonna make a little pile"],[[1,23],"of charcoal we're gonna get some burning"],[[1,25],"and then we're gonna try and find a"],[[1,26],"briquette that looks like it's just"],[[1,27],"exactly the same amount of burnt as the"],[[1,29],"one in the video okay"],[[1,39],"[Music]"],[[1,44],"now we're going to take a burning"],[[1,46],"charcoal inside the house which don't"],[[1,49],"take burning charcoal inside the house"],[[1,50],"guys carbon monoxide is real thing the"],[[1,53],"entire house already smells like burning"],[[1,54],"charcoal you guys this is a terrible"],[[1,56],"idea if you don't have good ventilation"],[[1,57],"well don't do this anyways but"],[[1,59],"especially don't do this in like a"],[[2,0],"closed room that's not how you do it"],[[2,5],"not all the way but yeah mostly more"],[[2,10],"little more oh it's good"],[[2,15],"charcoal into the peanut butter swirling"],[[2,19],"it around okay that looks pretty well"],[[2,22],"coated"],[[2,23],"get into ice okay more ice on top more"],[[2,27],"ice on top more MORE"],[[2,30],"a little bit more okay that's good now"],[[2,34],"we put it in the freezer"],[[2,36],"okay now real quick we have to leave it"],[[2,37],"in here for 24 hours real quick okay"],[[2,40],"wait for it we're gonna livestream next"],[[2,43],"24 hours"],[[2,44],"all right we've let the peanut butter"],[[2,47],"covered charcoal sit overnight now we"],[[2,49],"need to rinse this off in a bowl of warm"],[[2,50],"water"],[[2,54],"charcoal briquette but in the video"],[[2,56],"there's like a layer of it you kind of"],[[2,59],"got to work through"],[[3,1],"[Music]"],[[3,5],"wait I think I see some what no no way"],[[3,15],"guys there's a crystal in there okay"],[[3,25],"we've got a couple more let's try these"],[[3,26],"okay what it's like a metallic crystal"],[[3,36],"has anybody else ever gotten as a result"],[[3,38],"before check that one what's that yeah"],[[3,40],"what's this what's this whoa whoa whoa"],[[3,44],"whoa whoa hang on guys oh my gosh I"],[[3,51],"think it's a Pokemon it's a Bulbasaur"],[[3,54],"I made a Bulbasaur look at the metal the"],[[4,5],"Bulbasaur and the crystal are all"],[[4,6],"equally real none of these worked in"],[[4,10],"fact that's not even crystal that's"],[[4,13],"isomalt it's a sugar substitute this is"],[[4,16],"completely edible do you guys want to"],[[4,18],"know why this doesn't work there's about"],[[4,21],"a thousand reasons honestly well let's"],[[4,23],"break it down for you so we did have"],[[4,26],"actual charcoal briquettes and put in"],[[4,27],"the freezer but what we showed pulling"],[[4,29],"out of the bowl and then putting in warm"],[[4,30],"water and you saw the reveal we rubbed"],[[4,32],"away some charcoal and like all there's"],[[4,33],"crystal behind it we just took one of"],[[4,35],"these pieces of isomalt that was kind of"],[[4,37],"shaped like crystal we took some"],[[4,39],"charcoal powder we mixed it with some"],[[4,40],"water some corn syrup and some peanut"],[[4,42],"butter to give it a good consistency and"],[[4,44],"then we just stuck it to the outside of"],[[4,45],"our Bulbasaur R this is a small piece of"],[[4,47],"gallium and our isomalt crystal and we"],[[4,50],"just formed it into a sort of briquette"],[[4,52],"shaped froze it we had liquid nitrogen"],[[4,54],"so we used that but you could have just"],[[4,55],"as easily set it in the freezer for a"],[[4,57],"couple hours we just froze it then we"],[[4,59],"just spread peanut butter on it and we"],[[5,0],"put it in a bowl ice none of these were"],[[5,3],"even close to real let's take a look at"],[[5,6],"the real ones and see how those are"],[[5,7],"different we're doing a real test as"],[[5,9],"well we want to see what happens if we"],[[5,12],"don't fake this and try and get some"],[[5,13],"real results so we're gonna take three"],[[5,15],"more charcoal briquettes from a little"],[[5,16],"barbeque bonfire in the backyard we're"],[[5,19],"gonna get those in peanut butter and try"],[[5,20],"and coat them but as you saw the peanut"],[[5,22],"butter doesn't actually coat that well"],[[5,24],"so I think even in that part was faked"],[[5,25],"and then we're also going to see if we"],[[5,28],"can microwave one calorie why are we"],[[5,29],"trying the microwave so I looked at"],[[5,31],"several videos online yes there is a"],[[5,33],"really really popular one but it doesn't"],[[5,34],"actually show you how you're heating up"],[[5,36],"that charcoal briquette"],[[5,37],"I saw multiple other videos that say"],[[5,39],"that you're microwaving that briquette"],[[5,40],"so that's what I'm trying do you think"],[[5,43],"90 minutes is enough okay sorry about"],[[5,47],"your house grant all right so what's the"],[[5,52],"difference between this one and the last"],[[5,53],"one this one's real we're not going to"],[[5,56],"take it out and put a crystal inside of"],[[5,58],"it"],[[6,1],"[Music]"],[[6,3],"also the microwave smoking this cannot"],[[6,12],"be healthy oh so the video I watched"],[[6,19],"this guy put his briquette in the"],[[6,21],"microwave took it out dumped it in the"],[[6,23],"peanut butter and then said must leave"],[[6,24],"for a hundred minutes I'm gonna take"],[[6,26],"this out and dunk it in there and I'm"],[[6,27],"gonna pull it out and like now we're a"],[[6,29],"half don't show that person"],[[6,40],"[Music]"],[[6,41],"microwave briquette"],[[6,44],"[Music]"],[[6,48],"the briquette that we left in longer"],[[6,51],"that had most of the briquette was like"],[[6,53],"turning gray and it was on fire a little"],[[6,55],"bit like that's been dunked in a lot of"],[[6,57],"peanut butter knits under the ice it's"],[[6,58],"burning crate to the peanut there's"],[[6,59],"still like smoke coming up out through"],[[7,2],"everything and I can hear it it's like"],[[7,3],"boiling some of the ice away - I think"],[[7,5],"so I don't know if that smoke from the"],[[7,8],"peanut butter or steam from the heat and"],[[7,10],"ice but our microwave looks like it"],[[7,12],"might be about to light on fire so I"],[[7,13],"think it's time to take that charcoal"],[[7,14],"out the fire alarm it's gonna be there"],[[7,25],"laughs okay so we have let the charcoal"],[[7,28],"from the microwave sit in the peanut"],[[7,29],"butter for 100 minutes"],[[7,32],"aha I'll turn you to it how about is"],[[7,36],"that isn't really I can get it I know I"],[[7,39],"can uh-huh yup seems right"],[[7,45],"[Music]"],[[7,48],"you know what I'm gonna call that good"],[[7,51],"enough all right that's it for 24 hours"],[[7,58],"it's now been 24 hours it's time for the"],[[8,1],"reveal all right moment of truth this is"],[[8,10],"the real one an actual charcoal that was"],[[8,13],"hot when we put in peanut butter and"],[[8,15],"then we froze overnight"],[[8,16],"now we're gonna see what's really on the"],[[8,18],"inside there's actually a crystal in"],[[8,21],"here I'm guys guys look at this it's"],[[8,27],"still a briquette a slightly burnt piece"],[[8,29],"of charcoal can I break it"],[[8,31],"ant nope Nick get the hammer guys the"],[[8,35],"truth whole lot of charcoal inside that"],[[8,40],"charcoal nothing else are three"],[[8,42],"briquettes at different temperatures so"],[[8,44],"these were all on fire we let that fire"],[[8,47],"burn out one was a low heat one was a"],[[8,50],"medium one was high and then this is our"],[[8,53],"microwaved and then left in the peanut"],[[8,55],"butter for a hundred minutes just to see"],[[8,58],"oh look it's a charcoal briquette uh you"],[[9,4],"better break it just to be safe there's"],[[9,6],"the inside it's charcoal here try your"],[[9,9],"medium one just in case oh look another"],[[9,12],"charcoal briquette wood please"],[[9,20],"yeah more charcoal what about the one"],[[9,24],"that was like superheated most of it was"],[[9,26],"burning so first off you can see the"],[[9,29],"scorch marks from when we dropped it in"],[[9,31],"the peanut butter I got no crystal"],[[9,36],"inside all right my microwave one but I"],[[9,38],"followed all of the instructions"],[[9,39],"correctly what's this oh hey hey is it"],[[9,45],"charcoal it's charcoal no way oh look a"],[[9,51],"charcoal briquette guys you can't make"],[[9,54],"crystals out of charcoal and peanut"],[[9,56],"butter crystals are formed from volcanic"],[[9,58],"activity different kinds of rocks are"],[[10,1],"slowly cooling down"],[[10,2],"often under massive amounts of pressure"],[[10,4],"and I say slow I mean like it usually"],[[10,6],"takes thousands of years for good"],[[10,8],"crystals to form you can get those kits"],[[10,10],"in the store that you can make chemical"],[[10,12],"crystals over a couple of weeks but"],[[10,14],"again that's a couple of weeks with"],[[10,16],"chemicals that's different"],[[10,18],"there are ways you can do it even faster"],[[10,20],"than that sometimes I think grant has"],[[10,21],"done some where he boiled off all the"],[[10,23],"water in a pot and you're left with a"],[[10,25],"bunch of crystals growing in there that"],[[10,26],"looks pretty cool yeah but like this"],[[10,28],"doesn't even have an evaporation of"],[[10,30],"water to leave behind a residue that's"],[[10,32],"gonna form into a crystal and that's"],[[10,34],"something else we're talking about coal"],[[10,35],"and charcoal not the same thing"],[[10,37],"cally what is cold so cold is actually"],[[10,40],"the mineral anthracite and what that"],[[10,42],"basically is is it's a mineral composed"],[[10,44],"of carbon it takes millions of years to"],[[10,46],"make a lot of pressure and it's"],[[10,48],"basically the breakdown of plant remains"],[[10,51],"whereas what we've been using the"],[[10,52],"charcoal briquets charcoal is sometimes"],[[10,54],"called coal because it kind of resembles"],[[10,57],"it and is used in similar ways when you"],[[10,59],"burn it but charcoal is just wood or"],[[11,1],"other similar plant material that's been"],[[11,3],"burned in the absence of oxygen it's"],[[11,5],"something that you can make pretty"],[[11,7],"easily yourself and happens pretty much"],[[11,9],"every time you have a campfire you make"],[[11,10],"a fire and then there's like the black"],[[11,12],"stuff at the bottom that is still just"],[[11,14],"in lump shape that's just charcoal and"],[[11,16],"the briquettes are charcoal that's been"],[[11,18],"made and then broken up into light dust"],[[11,19],"and then compress down into just the"],[[11,20],"right shape with maybe a little bit of"],[[11,22],"other chemicals in to make it burn a"],[[11,24],"little bit better at least with this"],[[11,26],"kind of we're using not the same thing"],[[11,28],"as coal and doesn't turn into crystals"],[[11,30],"under this situation or possibly any"],[[11,32],"situation so pretty much everything"],[[11,34],"about this is just 100% nonsense and I"],[[11,37],"think honestly the people making the"],[[11,39],"video knew that there was 100% on tests"],[[11,42],"I don't think they are actually trying"],[[11,43],"to convince anyone well they were trying"],[[11,45],"to convince people was real I don't"],[[11,46],"think they thought it was real when they"],[[11,48],"faked it because they definitely faked"],[[11,49],"it they made it crystal we made a"],[[11,51],"Bulbasaur we win can you make Pokemon"],[[11,55],"guys that's not all we've always got"],[[11,57],"more for you to see if you hit this box"],[[11,59],"up at the top it will take you

just in all honesty"],[[7,10],"we're just gonna pretend Oh"],[[7,12],"with the purple this is bombed this"],[[7,25],"pigment I'm actually stroking sleeves I"],[[7,29],"like the way you say it wanna color on"],[[7,36],"women of people of color women on people"],[[7,39],"of color in actually a shiny which is"],[[7,42],"rare but I'm gonna go in with this shade"],[[7,43],"it's cold"],[[7,47],"OCP thing so I mean I stop it but don't"],[[8,2],"but you know I just I feel like stop"],[[8,4],"stop or keep going"],[[8,6],"Oh haters are gonna hate ballers I'm"],[[8,9],"gonna bawl okay but yeah"],[[8,11],"you know we can move on it's okay I'm"],[[8,13],"gonna say this shape a cappella isn't"],[[8,17],"giving me the pop look which colors this"],[[8,19],"one is on a cappella oh it's not even"],[[8,28],"like it's not even what what why is it"],[[8,44],"why is it doing that okay I'm gonna try"],[[8,47],"wetting it because a cappella was I"],[[8,49],"could disappearing it's not coming off"],[[8,51],"oh wow it's oh we didn't say well oh"],[[8,57],"dang the shimmer yeah it's the shimmer"],[[9,0],"is invisible hold on"],[[9,6],"it's a paving that it's just not maybe"],[[9,9],"you think that white this flashback"],[[9,12],"wasn't a good idea maybe it's not it's"],[[9,15],"not loving it I'm really shocked about"],[[9,17],"that didn't it I'm having to pack it"],[[9,19],"well intentionally but actually you know"],[[9,21],"it's starting to say hi that's what I do"],[[9,25],"enjoy your reviews it's never just like"],[[9,27],"a horrible you really try to figure out"],[[9,30],"a way to make it work that's the thing"],[[9,31],"right"],[[9,32],"if you've already spent your hard-earned"],[[9,34],"money on something and you can't we"],[[9,36],"can't return makeup no no you guys just"],[[9,38],"have makeup you can return makeup I"],[[9,39],"think we can I'm not sure I don't know"],[[9,43],"about morphe but we can't return makeup"],[[9,45],"therefore if I paid my money I'm gonna"],[[9,48],"have to make it work at this point in"],[[9,50],"time I'm just trying to finesse you've"],[[9,52],"got some power pools you've got some"],[[9,53],"blues going on so great I think I'm"],[[9,55],"gonna give you a little so good so good"],[[9,59],"wait let's see this"],[[10,6],"it's not appearing the weights on my"],[[10,8],"finger yeah exactly"],[[10,10],"that's what I'm

before hands yeah"],[[7,15],"he does he sometimes texts me them and"],[[7,17],"like he's also super avant-garde like"],[[7,19],"sometimes he'll write in things like"],[[7,21],"stop lyrics here curse

did you write these lyrics"],[[7,44],"down oh let's say with a pen and paper"],[[7,46],"on a computer you know how you ran down"],[[7,48],"we share a Google Drive because it's all"],[[7,50],"these things that I'm able to like look"],[[7,52],"in and just like you know put in notes"],[[7,54],"but they're not really gonna be taken to"],[[7,56],"West generally knows best what yeah so"],[[7,59],"you would say that the lyrics were in"],[[8,0],"his phone at the time of the ground oh"],[[8,2],"for sure why else would he have to check"],[[8,4],"it up upwards of 20 times oh did you"],[[8,7],"know that writing lyrics down in the"],[[8,9],"phone counts as a tangible medium of"],[[8,10],"expression under the 1976 Copyright Act"],[[8,12],"I did know that type writing down just"],[[8,14],"makes it tangible immediate time so that"],[[8,18],"again please you just say it again"],[[8,19],"I knew that we're beyond that okay"],[[8,25],"[Music]"],[[8,27],"so Wes his brother Brendan five wise

definitely"],[[9,28],"legal oh he's definitely like a real NBA"],[[9,31],"type of person if he's not supposed to"],[[9,33],"talk he's not gonna talk oh good because"],[[9,37],"what I can tell you is that in an actual"],[[9,40],"contract for Smosh games it states very"],[[9,44],"clearly that any ideas you come up with"],[[9,47],"wall employed at Smosh games are"],[[9,49],"therefore property of

known Wesley Allen Johnson or"],[[12,28],"as the court may know him as wws uh I"],[[12,32],"don't know six years seven so very good"],[[12,36],"friends know each other for a very long"],[[12,37],"time"],[[12,37],"yep um in the course of our entire"],[[12,40],"friendship how many times have you heard"],[[12,42],"Wes rap ah several times I mean you know"],[[12,47],"the Smosh Summer Games is one of those"],[[12,49],"times he's got a new album obviously"],[[12,52],"look at his I don't think that's obvious"],[[12,54],"on this album is is the west rap on"],[[12,58],"there nobody's got a diss track of"],[[13,1],"course I am about to read you an excerpt"],[[13,6],"from the subject rap are you familiar"],[[13,7],"with it yes I am tell me if these lyrics"],[[13,9],"sound familiar"],[[13,10],"okay my name is Wes I'm from the wild"],[[13,13],"wild west I'm about to get shot in the"],[[13,16],"motherfucking chest does that sound"],[[13,19],"familiar to you oh yeah that's super"],[[13,24],"familiar we heard it many many times"],[[13,27],"many many times first of all what do"],[[13,30],"these lyrics mean to you um you know"],[[13,33],"hope and a man just try and message to"],[[13,38],"embrace the hip-hop culture a man trying"],[[13,41],"to embrace the hip-hop culture who would"],[[13,43],"that man be it's our very own Wesley"],[[13,45],"Johnson our very own Wesley Johnson so"],[[13,47],"not Smosh as a company right it's I"],[[13,50],"would like two completely separate"],[[13,53],"myself from the west rap I don't think"],[[13,56],"that that is a wholesome representation"],[[13,58],"of the rest of us at Smosh games that is"],[[14,1],"solely West that terrible terrible rap"],[[14,3],"is all his well you may be in luck"],[[14,7],"because the defense likes to"],[[14,9],"misrepresent the contract that"],[[14,11],"supposedly you all signed as"],[[14,13],"that any ideas that are created while in"],[[14,15],"the appointment of Smosh are owned by"],[[14,17],"Smosh but would it surprise you to know"],[[14,18],"that the contract signed by the"],[[14,21],"plaintiff said that any ideas that he"],[[14,23],"comes up with in perpetuity are owned by"],[[14,26],"Smosh would it surprise you to know that"],[[14,28],"such a clause is unconscionable ladies"],[[14,39],"and gentlemen of the jury uh ordinarily"],[[14,42],"I would move for a mistrial since we do"],[[14,44],"not have a real judge presiding nor do"],[[14,46],"we have an actual lawyer on the other"],[[14,47],"side however I believe I have one so I'm"],[[14,50],"gonna continue as if this were any other"],[[14,52],"case he wants to fight cocky with cocky"],[[14,55],"all right go for this is my closing go"],[[14,58],"for it we have established that the"],[[14,59],"plaintiff West is inspiring rapper the"],[[15,3],"quality of his raps is not at issue and"],[[15,5],"frankly it's quite atrocious but that is"],[[15,6],"not what we're arguing about he wrote"],[[15,8],"the lyrics to the subject rap down in"],[[15,11],"his phone before filming of his"],[[15,14],"performance Smosh never obtained"],[[15,16],"obtained a license or written permission"],[[15,19],"to use that song over and over and over"],[[15,21],"again in its videos that is why we are"],[[15,23],"seeking an injunction prohibiting Smosh"],[[15,25],"from using that song or that footage"],[[15,27],"ever again we are also seeking damages"],[[15,29],"and punitive damages in an amount no"],[[15,32],"less than a hundred million dollars"],[[15,34],"because nothing less than a large"],[[15,36],"portion will fully compensate the"],[[15,39],"plaintiff for the humiliation he has had"],[[15,41],"to endure we need to stop Smosh from"],[[15,44],"using these kinds of sad performances as"],[[15,46],"an attempt to ruin one of its own"],[[15,48],"members careers furthermore I've"],[[15,50],"established that the the contract of"],[[15,52],"West's signs is invalid it's"],[[15,54],"unconscionable no court would ever"],[[15,56],"uphold it no ideas that he came up with"],[[15,58],"in the employment of Smosh or otherwise"],[[16,0],"are owned by Smosh he is free to become"],[[16,2],"the best rapper he can possibly be which"],[[16,4],"albeit might not be a very good one but"],[[16,6],"he is free to pursue that goal"],[[16,9],"[Applause]"],[[16,15],"you have your closing minutes I did but"],[[16,22],"I think I'm gonna switch it up a little"],[[16,23],"bit all right so this is the fun"],[[16,28],"probably the most expensive prank we've"],[[16,30],"ever done here on the show I had a good"],[[16,35],"time up there you guys had a good time"],[[16,38],"here"],[[16,38],"you got some laps but I think that we"],[[16,41],"need to take my character out of this"],[[16,43],"conversation a little bit we get joven"],[[16,46],"we get the bronze player but there's"],[[16,47],"something larger here now I mentioned"],[[16,49],"the bronze player because through this"],[[16,52],"six years of experience that I've had"],[[16,53],"here at Smosh games I've learned that"],[[16,55],"there's something about being the"],[[16,57],"underdog you don't always have to win to"],[[17,0],"be a winner and that is something that I"],[[17,2],"think our audience not only sees"],[[17,6],"respects and appreciates and going from"],[[17,10],"bronze to platinum not only was one of"],[[17,12],"the greatest moments of my life but a"],[[17,15],"defining moment for a lot of"],[[17,17],"up-and-coming teenagers who see that and"],[[17,20],"maybe see themselves as a bronze player"],[[17,22],"who know that they become they will one"],[[17,25],"day become a mr. platinum of their own"],[[17,27],"now with the west rap was it good no it"],[[17,31],"objectively was bad does the smart"],[[17,33],"lawyer said that it was but at the end"],[[17,36],"of the day there are hundreds of"],[[17,38],"thousands of other children that see"],[[17,40],"that video"],[[17,40],"and they see that rap and they are"],[[17,42],"reminded constantly that my raps aren't"],[[17,45],"that good either but it's funny and if"],[[17,49],"someone is successful as wws now has a"],[[17,53],"career ahead of him where he can do"],[[17,55],"whatever he wants and as well as he"],[[17,57],"possibly can that is the image that we"],[[17,59],"give not only to our fans but every"],[[18,2],"single viewer that sees that rap every"],[[18,4],"single time we replay that video now I'm"],[[18,6],"not asking you to give him the rights"],[[18,10],"I'm asking you to give hope to a"],[[18,13],"generation people that are raised not"],[[18,16],"only on on Smosh games but raised on"],[[18,18],"YouTube to let the"],[[18,20],"at home know that whatever they want to"],[[18,22],"do within you're good at it or not that"],[[18,24],"good at all you can still be the best"],[[18,26],"person that you're gonna be and guess"],[[18,28],"what we're gonna love you for it so take"],[[18,31],"me out of the picture it doesn't matter"],[[18,33],"mr. bronze all the way take him out of"],[[18,36],"the picture it's realistic a boy how"],[[18,38],"efficient is that the end of the day"],[[18,39],"it's not we don't do these videos for us"],[[18,42],"we don't we don't come up here and and"],[[18,44],"make youtube videos just like oh I'm"],[[18,46],"gonna do too but that's not what it is"],[[18,47],"at the end of the day we make videos"],[[18,49],"because we break down the fourth wall to"],[[18,51],"our friends at home we break down the"],[[18,53],"fourth wall for you guys so that you're"],[[18,55],"hanging out with us and you can see how"],[[18,57],"great you can be as a person and also if"],[[19,0],"we give him a hundred million dollars"],[[19,2],"you guys are all still employees of"],[[19,4],"Smosh games you won't get paid and we'll"],[[19,6],"be out of work so don't vote oh they"],[[19,12],"tell you to but with your heart we the"],[[19,24],"completely impartial jury who have no"],[[19,26],"stake in this have deliberated and we"],[[19,28],"have all collectively decided in favor"],[[19,31],"of the the plaintiff for Wes and so defy"],[[19,38],"media parent company of Smosh games and"],[[19,41],"Smosh was forced to pay Wesley Allen"],[[19,43],"Johnson the sum of 100 million dollars"],[[19,46],"causing them to close their

and wanted us to investigate in their"],[[0,21],"house I guess they had bought this house"],[[0,23],"they lived in it as a child and they"],[[0,26],"started renovating it and they decided"],[[0,28],"not to move into it because this house"],[[0,30],"is so haunted now it's in really bad"],[[0,33],"shape that's why I'm wearing this mask"],[[0,35],"he said that he has brought people here"],[[0,38],"that didn't believe in the paranormal"],[[0,40],"and they were so convinced afterwards he"],[[0,43],"told me that within 10 minutes if I"],[[0,45],"don't see something that convinces me"],[[0,47],"that this house is on it that you could"],[[0,48],"call them a crazy man now this house"],[[0,50],"isn't that big there's not a lot to"],[[0,52],"explore here and that's what what was it"],[[0,58],"all right that didn't take long"],[[1,0],"but we are gonna do a uncut video James"],[[1,4],"is also going to do this we're gonna"],[[1,6],"split up in the house we're gonna be"],[[1,8],"really quiet - please let us know if you"],[[1,10],"hear or see anything we are in"],[[1,12],"Massachusetts by the way and you could"],[[1,14],"see that's probably why the paint is"],[[1,17],"peeling"],[[1,18],"I mean Massachusetts if you didn't know"],[[1,19],"we do get some cold winters up here hope"],[[1,22],"you're ready for this adventure let's do"],[[1,24],"this"],[[1,39],"[Music]"],[[1,46],"good luck James the only cuts that you"],[[1,52],"seen worked on my intro and maybe some"],[[1,55],"of that b-roll but from now on there is"],[[1,57],"not gonna be one cut unless I happen to"],[[2,0],"you know run out of battery here I know"],[[2,2],"my camera only allows me to film for a"],[[2,4],"ball stink 25 minutes so it's gonna be"],[[2,8],"it's gonna be ill probably a longer"],[[2,10],"video a lot have you been asking me to"],[[2,12],"do a no cut no edit type video so that's"],[[2,16],"what I got here and if you do enjoy this"],[[2,18],"type of video let me know in the"],[[2,20],"comments I have got this beautiful"],[[2,24],"fireplace here"],[[2,25],"[Music]"],[[2,30],"I'm not gonna really say a whole lot"],[[2,50],"hey James how long did you say this has"],[[2,54],"been like abandoned again ten years this"],[[3,1],"looks 10 years ago and they were going"],[[3,8],"to remodel it or something and basically"],[[3,11],"the the things that were happening here"],[[3,14],"scared them so much the workers that be"],[[3,15],"hiring different work in here I did hear"],[[3,17],"that we worked in here and then they"],[[3,20],"came in here to try to notice stuff and"],[[3,21],"they started noticing crazy things and"],[[3,23],"they lost a lot of money I really heard"],[[3,25],"their family but they said for their"],[[3,27],"family's safety and this is what she"],[[3,28],"remembers that further family safety"],[[3,30],"they decided to take a loss and to get"],[[3,32],"the heck out of here so she's always"],[[3,34],"wondered what ever happened in this"],[[3,36],"place and what the real deal with this"],[[3,37],"place is that's why we're here you could"],[[3,41],"see they started doing some plumbing"],[[3,43],"work and maybe some of the some of the"],[[3,48],"remodeling you might see some of that"],[[3,50],"here I've never been in here before"],[[3,54],"[Applause]"],[[3,56],"it's not wow that's really nice built-in"],[[4,1],"there I like that"],[[4,16],"guess James is going to the basement"],[[4,20],"let's go check out upstairs oh it has an"],[[4,26],"attic cool"],[[4,36],"[Music]"],[[4,49],"it sounded like there was somebody"],[[4,52],"behind me on the stairs"],[[4,55],"[Applause]"],[[5,6],"[Applause]"],[[5,11],"and you can see evidence of workers"],[[5,14],"holding here for sure"],[[5,20],"[Music]"],[[5,39],"yeah no dude there's something that went"],[[5,47],"up the stairs behind me"],[[5,57],"there's something definitely here"],[[6,6],"I don't know if you know this about me"],[[6,8],"but I mean if you do have a haunted"],[[6,10],"house that you want me to take a look at"],[[6,12],"let me reach out to me let me know I'll"],[[6,15],"make a video I'll do an investigation"],[[6,18],"but yeah at this place"],[[6,23],"definitely something here well means"],[[6,27],"sometimes these things take time"],[[6,29],"you know like you have to spend a lot of"],[[6,30],"time in a place I don't think I've only"],[[6,33],"been maybe in like three years uh I have"],[[6,37],"to say at least five places where like"],[[6,40],"from the start"],[[6,41],"there was some something there you know"],[[6,44],"I mean and there's been some places"],[[6,46],"where they are considered like the most"],[[6,49],"haunted place in the world and I didn't"],[[6,51],"see anything you know"],[[7,3],"and we're doing some plumbing work for"],[[7,6],"sure"],[[7,19],"I wonder how sick this is"],[[7,38],"looks like to fill this in with okay"],[[7,41],"that's Mordor"],[[7,42],"must have been like a I don't know like"],[[7,44],"a shower pan there's something"],[[7,54],"I heard some stomping - yeah that wasn't"],[[8,4],"you yo don't even play and you were a"],[[8,10],"lot you were it's almost like we're live"],[[8,15],"you know what would be kind of nice for"],[[8,18],"you guys to do if you want nobody you"],[[8,20],"know we're not BS in here as soon as"],[[8,23],"like we you know push but not push play"],[[8,25],"about when we say that like hey this is"],[[8,28],"because obviously we have the intro we"],[[8,30],"had some b-roll shots and right when we"],[[8,32],"said we are not doing any edits maybe"],[[8,34],"watch the videos side by side but I mean"],[[8,38],"so you're getting kind of like I don't"],[[8,42],"know it's almost like a like a live"],[[8,43],"preview of of each scene yeah I mean I"],[[8,48],"don't know you could be there I don't"],[[8,49],"you could probably you can only listen"],[[8,51],"up this

here"],[[10,4],"oh that's probably what happened so like"],[[10,8],"I heard like a oh no it's like something"],[[10,10],"got so don't let me hear something or"],[[10,12],"maybe I don't know if they got thrown at"],[[10,13],"me or maybe it fell from somewhere you"],[[10,15],"know I don't know if it was downstairs"],[[10,18],"or I'm pretty sure was this maybe it was"],[[10,21],"that I'm thinking

this floor up"],[[14,50],"with like concrete yeah"],[[15,40],"[Music]"],[[15,42],"that's the feeling I got up in the attic"],[[15,50],"almost like lost my balance when I was"],[[15,52],"on that ladder and if before I lost my"],[[15,56],"balance I felt like it was like a force"],[[15,58],"it was like it didn't want me on that"],[[16,0],"ladder or something now that you thought"],[[16,4],"my god like Oh what was that"],[[16,8],"no what happened I mean it could be done"],[[16,19],"this is an old house"],[[16,20],"and you're gonna hear a lot of things"],[[16,23],"but I mean it is a haunted house"],[[16,40],"[Music]"],[[16,47],"but do me a favor"],[[16,49],"like let's just be quiet for like five"],[[16,53],"minutes to see if like something wants"],[[16,57],"to communicate with us oh you just"],[[17,15],"walked right into it right now what is"],[[17,26],"this just like the kitchen or something"],[[17,28],"this is a smallest kitchen ever"],[[17,44],"I would love to see this house like the"],[[17,59],"way it was now you may be wondering like"],[[18,10],"what makes a house haunted now the real"],[[18,15],"popular like most popular paranormal"],[[18,18],"investigators one of my favorite"],[[18,20],"paranormal investigators ed and Lorraine"],[[18,22],"Lauren they said that I think is it's a"],[[18,26],"very high percentage 80% or 85% of"],[[18,30],"hauntings"],[[18,31],"that they would investigate had to do"],[[18,34],"with the Ouija board this is why I do"],[[18,37],"not play with Ouija boards I mean I had"],[[18,41],"them in my videos I've burned them"],[[18,42],"before I've maybe documented a few of"],[[18,45],"them but but I do not play weed Awards"],[[18,50],"that's coming from some old-school"],[[18,52],"paranormal investigators I mean they've"],[[18,54],"made movies that's where the movie the"],[[18,56],"conjuring came from true story"],[[19,12],"you're gonna come with me oh this does I"],[[19,16],"feel safe oh look here's the garage Wow"],[[19,25],"look at that"],[[19,35],"it was a mosquito right there heaps yeah"],[[19,48],"James talks too damn much hey shut up"],[[19,57],"all I hear is you talking all I hear is"],[[20,1],"you talking you're ending it already bro"],[[20,6],"this is the worst time to end it"],[[20,10],"okay sorry sir that's why James talking"],[[20,17],"off wow it's really pulled down here"],[[20,21],"most basements are it's because like"],[[20,25],"heat rises you know I feel bad for kind"],[[20,30],"of being mean to change I know you talk"],[[20,33],"so what fine you want to hear the"],[[20,37],"spirits all I can change"],[[20,52],"this one a little bit really not much oh"],[[21,2],"[Applause]"],[[21,7],"cool"],[[21,11],"[Applause]"],[[21,14],"so we'll utility area a little tour of"],[[21,25],"couple different things you have to"],[[21,27],"worry about when you come to like old"],[[21,29],"places especially old abandoned places"],[[21,32],"and a lot of them is this right here"],[[21,35],"like if you mess with that dust asbestos"],[[21,38],"asbestos and what makes this better so"],[[21,41],"bad may have may not heard about it but"],[[21,43],"the dust of it has these little hooks"],[[21,46],"that getting your lungs in I mean you"],[[21,49],"could get to have a like mesothelioma as"],[[21,51],"well I think that's one of them don't"],[[21,53],"quote me on that"],[[21,53],"I know lung cancer for sure but another"],[[21,56],"thing is to and I learned this in real"],[[21,59],"estate school most houses are a lot of"],[[22,1],"houses built before 1978 had lead-based"],[[22,6],"paint and you could get lead poisoning"],[[22,8],"from lead-based paint from the dust"],[[22,11],"particles I mean you're not gonna put a"],[[22,14],"piece of paint in your mouth you know"],[[22,16],"I'm not gonna I'm

and habitat for two aquadragons, i.e. axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum). These very unique and cute amphibians, which are closely related to tiger salamanders are pretty interesting creatures. In this video, we watch these two axolotls evolve from strangers to best friends. We also watch how they hunt, forage, relax, and feed. You'll be surprised how intelligent and endearing they are.

thing I almost"],[[0,7],"forgot"],[[0,8],"speaking of preservation of life some of"],[[0,11],"you might be wondering what happened to"],[[0,13],"a certain white aqua dragon our most"],[[0,16],"recent addition to the anti verse who"],[[0,19],"was placed into the golden Springs last"],[[0,21],"week to help with eating dead ends if"],[[0,23],"the lava thien's and rustboro fish are"],[[0,25],"living there now where is the white aqua"],[[0,28],"dragon well last week I as well as many"],[[0,33],"of you felt our newcomer needed a bigger"],[[0,36],"space to live one that was colder and"],[[0,39],"more interesting for the dragon"],[[0,41],"well a sea family in a parallel universe"],[[0,44],"an unexplored underworld the abyss much"],[[0,48],"more frigid inhabited by the likes of"],[[0,51],"giant Griffins and water world's teeming"],[[0,54],"with life sprung my newest grand"],[[0,57],"creation AC family behold"],[[1,1],"welcome to axolotl land into which"],[[1,4],"someone special is about to move in"],[[1,20],"enjoy in a floating rush of bubbles and"],[[1,23],"water our white aqua dragon floated to"],[[1,27],"the sandy bottom floor of exelon land"],[[1,30],"[Music]"],[[1,33],"it stood still for a moment realizing"],[[1,36],"that it was no longer in the Golden"],[[1,38],"Springs that perhaps the Golden Springs"],[[1,41],"was more of a temporary holding cell"],[[1,43],"what a peculiar world he thought to"],[[1,46],"himself it was rather colorful but cozy"],[[1,50],"and much bigger of a space than he was"],[[1,53],"used to and then suddenly the skies"],[[1,57],"darkened another flurry of bubbles and"],[[1,59],"water Oh thought he had seen a tail but"],[[2,7],"perhaps it was just his imagination or"],[[2,11],"not she too was quite bewildered by the"],[[2,18],"new environment this aqua dragon was"],[[2,22],"larger with a differently shaped face"],[[2,25],"our first aqua dragon was determined to"],[[2,28],"just stay put he wasn't going to move an"],[[2,31],"inch he was nervous and unsure what was"],[[2,35],"going on meanwhile our female had"],[[2,38],"decided to start snooping around towards"],[[2,40],"the back she too had never experienced a"],[[2,42],"land this large a rounded corner how"],[[2,46],"peculiar she turned to approach her shy"],[[2,50],"friend hey buddy she called hey man what"],[[2,55],"do you think of this place pretty weird"],[[2,57],"huh"],[[2,57],"um hello"],[[3,0],"are you alive it's a myth that we"],[[3,3],"axolotls are blind you know I can"],[[3,6],"totally see you respiring she looked and"],[[3,9],"prodded and tried to investigate what"],[[3,11],"was going on with her seemingly frozen"],[[3,13],"friend but he wouldn't budge so she"],[[3,17],"decided she was just going to move on"],[[3,18],"and continue exploring these new vacant"],[[3,21],"lands alright get off me already our"],[[3,25],"male axolotl said he was determined to"],[[3,28],"explore these strange lands on his own a"],[[3,30],"little antisocial perhaps but he's had a"],[[3,33],"long 24 hours now if you look carefully"],[[3,36],"at our female aqua dragon"],[[3,38],"you may notice she has some injuries"],[[3,40],"she's recovering from her last home at"],[[3,43],"the pet shop was packed with many"],[[3,45],"axolotls in unclean waters so she could"],[[3,48],"be recovering from injuries from tank"],[[3,50],"mates or previous unclean water from her"],[[3,53],"last home I've chosen her in hopes to"],[[3,55],"show her a better life with us in exelon"],[[3,59],"land and what an interesting world it"],[[4,2],"was a sea family axolotl and was a large"],[[4,6],"30 gallon cubical space for our aqua"],[[4,9],"dragons to fly through its echoey spaces"],[[4,11],"I've created axolotl and to be an"],[[4,14],"enchanted mountain village perfect"],[[4,16],"habitat for a dragon great java moss"],[[4,20],"covered wooden arches stretched from one"],[[4,22],"end of the valley to the next"],[[4,29],"these mosses would help with absorbing"],[[4,31],"some toxic nitrogenous compounds"],[[4,33],"produced from the Aqua dragons wastes in"],[[4,35],"between water changes every two days"],[[4,38],"another one of my favorite axolotl"],[[4,41],"landmarks is this cute bubble feature a"],[[4,44],"bubble spring to help give these waters"],[[4,47],"a bit of an oxygenating boost and word"],[[4,50],"has it aqua dragons love playing in them"],[[4,58],"this place isn't so bad I guess but it"],[[5,1],"doesn't mean I have to make friends with"],[[5,3],"anyone he said as he stomped his way"],[[5,6],"forward you are saying the two aqua"],[[5,10],"dragons came face-to-face what were they"],[[5,13],"gonna do would they fight they inched"],[[5,16],"their way closer"],[[5,18],"[Music]"],[[5,37],"in the end the mail turned around and"],[[5,40],"backed away though the two were not"],[[5,43],"friends at first I knew eventually our"],[[5,45],"mail would warm up to his larger more of"],[[5,48],"going companion and I was right as the"],[[5,52],"days went on"],[[5,53],"they shared cave space they looked so"],[[5,56],"cute together in the shadows"],[[5,58],"speaking in caves axolotl and wouldn't"],[[6,2],"be dragon habitat if it didn't have its"],[[6,4],"share of dragons den like caves and"],[[6,7],"darkened retreats the aqua dragons would"],[[6,12],"peek their heads out of cave holes to"],[[6,15],"let the you didn't do your research"],[[6,16],"armino hey guys I'm okay eventually it"],[[6,22],"became clear that they were used to"],[[6,25],"hanging out together chillin at a"],[[6,27],"healthy distance from each other aware"],[[6,29],"of each other's presence and doing their"],[[6,31],"thing"],[[6,32],"while periodically taking gulps of air"],[[6,34],"at the surface in fact I loved watching"],[[6,37],"them ascend to the water surface to take"],[[6,39],"gulps of air they were just so cute I"],[[6,42],"could literally watch them bobbing for"],[[6,44],"air all night long"],[[6,47],"[Music]"],[[6,52],"I would catch them frolicking together"],[[6,55],"around the bubble Springs seems the"],[[6,57],"rumors are true what I think my favorite"],[[7,1],"thing I catch them doing is seeing how"],[[7,3],"they chillax on this moss covered"],[[7,5],"driftwood check her out just chillin"],[[7,10],"suspended in her sweet spot in fact the"],[[7,13],"axolotls have amazing floating"],[[7,15],"capabilities which make it look like"],[[7,17],"they are floating downwards from the"],[[7,19],"skies a few times I will catch our aqua"],[[7,22],"dragons doing this hanging out on the"],[[7,24],"mosses like they are the greatest beds"],[[7,26],"around it's just adorable how relaxed"],[[7,38],"and comfy she looks up there on her bed"],[[7,41],"of moss this AC family is apparently a"],[[7,44],"Moss bed fit for a German the axolotls"],[[7,48],"will frequently hop from mas bed to mas"],[[7,51],"bed relaxing for a brief period now"],[[7,54],"axolotls usually get stressed under"],[[7,56],"light as they're naturally nocturnal"],[[7,58],"creatures but they have been known to"],[[8,0],"get used to some lights I feel our aqua"],[[8,3],"dragons here must have been raised under"],[[8,5],"lights and don't mind the lights we've"],[[8,7],"chosen to illuminate axolotl and such"],[[8,10],"good aqua dragons I wished I could give"],[[8,13],"this one some scratches as she watched"],[[8,15],"the bubble spring you could really sense"],[[8,18],"that these creatures were intelligent as"],[[8,20],"you saw in our video two weeks ago these"],[[8,23],"guys loved bloodworms but I also loved"],[[8,26],"feeding them earthworms check it out I"],[[8,29],"see family"],[[8,30],"[Music]"],[[8,36],"she smells it and sucks it into her"],[[8,41],"mouth delicious the only problem with"],[[8,48],"earthworms I found was that sometimes"],[[8,50],"the earthworms would go undetected by"],[[8,53],"the axial arms and I would often have to"],[[8,55],"retrieve the earthworms to try again"],[[8,57],"until they found them so the breeder"],[[9,7],"recommended I try feeding them a quality"],[[9,9],"meat pellet that he used made of shrimp"],[[9,12],"fish and chicken components let's put"],[[9,16],"some in now for them"],[[9,18],"[Music]"],[[9,25],"they're a sinking Pelin and float right"],[[9,27],"to the bottom it was perfect timing"],[[9,29],"because our aqua dragons were hungry and"],[[9,33],"foraging for food leaving no cave nor"],[[9,36],"crevice unturned"],[[9,37],"this one was certain she'd find some"],[[9,39],"food in this cave she was going in I"],[[9,46],"knew it was only a matter of time before"],[[9,49],"the smell of these meat pellets would"],[[9,51],"start to float its way towards the axe"],[[9,53],"Alone's and sure enough it wasn't long"],[[9,57],"before our aqua dragons had picked up"],[[9,59],"the scent of the food she smells"],[[10,6],"something"],[[10,14],"she sticks her nose to the ground"],[[10,16],"axolotls hunt by scent as well as"],[[10,19],"through movement in the water picked up"],[[10,21],"to lateral line organs at the sides of"],[[10,23],"their heads and trunk but in this case"],[[10,25],"the pellets are going to have to be"],[[10,27],"found primarily through smell she"],[[10,29],"frequently takes mini vacuum sucks with"],[[10,32],"her mouth when she thinks there's food"],[[10,33],"in front of them it's how they catch"],[[10,35],"their prey and look who else has managed"],[[10,37],"to catch a whiff of the meat pellets the"],[[10,40],"male was inching closer as well as the"],[[10,46],"Femi"],[[10,51],"[Music]"],[[10,53],"our mail comes closer and"],[[11,13],"BAM success it looks like our female is"],[[11,17],"having some issues she's sucking at"],[[11,19],"nothing at the moment axolotls allegedly"],[[11,22],"have okay Ison but not the best Ison"],[[11,26],"they rely greatly on their smell and"],[[11,29],"movement perception our female knows"],[[11,31],"it's here somewhere she can sense it"],[[11,34],"somewhere in this crevice"],[[11,40],"[Music]"],[[11,41],"which is confident she's close"],[[11,49],"she sucks in a blast of water and Oh"],[[11,53],"missed its now by her feet our mail"],[[11,58],"smells appellate quite near well he"],[[12,0],"managed to suck it up from this crevice"],[[12,2],"let's watch I swear I am always on the"],[[12,6],"edge of my seat watching these acts of"],[[12,7],"all speedy"],[[12,11],"[Music]"],[[12,18],"strike Oh didn't reach the Pope he tries"],[[12,22],"again he just knows it's here"],[[12,26],"[Music]"],[[12,36],"and yeah did he get it nope still there"],[[12,41],"he tried again and missed finally third"],[[12,47],"time's a charm"],[[12,50],"success he spits out the sand that came"],[[12,53],"in with the catch but inevitably he may"],[[12,56],"swallow a few grains this sand is very"],[[12,59],"fine however and should pass through a"],[[13,1],"system okay"],[[13,2],"some axolotl keepers keep their tanks"],[[13,4],"bare in fear of sand impaction while"],[[13,7],"others swear they've used fine sand for"],[[13,9],"years without problems now a sea family"],[[13,12],"what I saw next was the cutest thing"],[[13,15],"ever our male and female aqua dragons"],[[13,22],"came face-to-face and like a cute couple"],[[13,26],"and loved nuzzled each other without any"],[[13,30],"squabble or annoyance these two were"],[[13,34],"definitely besties now as they searched"],[[13,36],"for food together along the floor of"],[[13,39],"their Kingdom"],[[13,44],"[Music]"],[[13,46],"I was happy that our axolotls had now"],[[13,51],"become official friends I never saw any"],[[13,54],"aggression between these two they would"],[[13,56],"sometimes nudge each other out of each"],[[13,58],"other's way but there was never any"],[[14,0],"fight nor biting which can happen when"],[[14,3],"axolotls are put together in a space"],[[14,5],"that's too confining perhaps one day"],[[14,8],"they may become more than friends"],[[14,10],"could you imagine if one day these two"],[[14,13],"end up mating and we have baby

rules"],[[1,3],"I can't wait to shoot me a ghost cowboy"],[[1,5],"in the street I don't even know how that"],[[1,7],"works but I'll be right there beside you"],[[1,9],"buddy well the city of Tombstone was"],[[1,17],"founded by Ed Schieffelin in 1877 and"],[[1,20],"was involved in a scouting expedition"],[[1,22],"against the Chiricahua Apaches and was"],[[1,25],"staying at Camp Huachuca according to"],[[1,27],"legend while at this camp"],[[1,29],"ed would set out into the desert to look"],[[1,31],"for areas to prospect"],[[1,32],"despite his fellow soldiers warning him"],[[1,34],"that he'd instead quote find his"],[[1,36],"tombstone"],[[1,36],"end quote but much to the surprise of"],[[1,39],"his friends ed did not find his"],[[1,41],"tombstone but instead it came upon what"],[[1,44],"he would make into a whole mine of"],[[1,46],"silver not one to shy away from a good"],[[1,48],"roast and named this mine the tombstone"],[[1,51],"a nod to his friends jokes as word"],[[1,54],"spread about his find people began to"],[[1,57],"flood the area leading to the creation"],[[1,59],"of the town tombstone in 1879 named for"],[[2,3],"its proximity to that first mine very"],[[2,5],"funny could you imagine if your friends"],[[2,8],"gave you a bunch of a they razzed you"],[[2,10],"for everyone really gave me the business"],[[2,12],"and then that one thing they razzed you"],[[2,14],"for doing ended up making you a fortune"],[[2,16],"yeah I'd buy all their land and turn it"],[[2,18],"into a railroad or something really just"],[[2,20],"keep on keep on humiliating them for the"],[[2,23],"rest of their lives"],[[2,24],"by the mid-1880s as many as 27,000"],[[2,28],"people called tombstone their home"],[[2,29],"making it one of the fastest populating"],[[2,32],"cities of its time along with a"],[[2,34],"population boom the town saw at least"],[[2,36],"100 saloons open and a large red-light"],[[2,39],"district as the u.s. expanded to the"],[[2,41],"west after the Civil War class and"],[[2,44],"economic tension began to rise up"],[[2,46],"specifically in Tombstone a political"],[[2,48],"power struggle formed on one side was"],[[2,51],"the country living ranch families led by"],[[2,53],"the Clanton's and the McLaurys cowboys"],[[2,55],"who reportedly had the sympathy of"],[[2,57],"Cochise County Sheriff John behan on the"],[[3,0],"other side was the wealthy mine owners"],[[3,2],"and business men of Tombstone backed by"],[[3,5],"the family of Morgan Wyatt and Virgil"],[[3,7],"Earp who was the town's marshal at the"],[[3,9],"time both sides blame the other for"],[[3,11],"corruption and collusion you gotta"],[[3,13],"imagine there's not a lot of checks and"],[[3,14],"balances back then the checks and"],[[3,16],"balances were holstered on the hips"],[[3,18],"exactly right"],[[3,19],"I got your tax and balances right here I"],[[3,23],"got you well I didn't know we were"],[[3,25],"starting okay you know wait a second"],[[3,27],"it's a gunfight works yet to say when"],[[3,28],"wait wait wait I'm dirty"],[[3,30],"you're not saying dirty I got you there"],[[3,32],"is respect to a gunfight not what Dirty"],[[3,34],"Shame comes into town that's what your"],[[3,36],"name would be dirty show dirty shame no"],[[3,39],"nothing like that it doesn't matter"],[[3,40],"because you're dead the stage is now set"],[[3,42],"for the main reason tombstone is still"],[[3,45],"considered legendary today the gunfight"],[[3,48],"at the OK Corral the lethal gunfight"],[[3,50],"occurred on October 26 1881 at the time"],[[3,54],"there was an ordinance in Tombstone"],[[3,56],"barring the carrying of guns in public"],[[3,58],"the herb set out to disarm a gang of"],[[4,0],"Cowboys hanging out in a vacant lot"],[[4,2],"behind the OK Corral the Cowboys"],[[4,5],"consisted of their rivals the Clanton's"],[[4,7],"and the McLaurys"],[[4,8],"the Earp's were joined by their friend"],[[4,10],"John Henry Doc Holliday"],[[4,12],"a dentist with a reputation as a gambler"],[[4,14],"and a drunk but also as one of the"],[[4,17],"fastest pistols in the West Doc Holliday"],[[4,20],"Wyatt Earp Virgil Earp and Morgan Earp"],[[4,23],"each carried a revolver"],[[4,24],"Holliday also had a concealed shotgun in"],[[4,27],"his coat on the side of the Cowboys"],[[4,29],"Billy Clanton had a revolver but his"],[[4,32],"brother Ike was unarmed having been"],[[4,34],"reportedly disarmed by Virgil Earp"],[[4,36],"earlier in the day similarly Frank"],[[4,39],"McLaury had a revolver but his brother"],[[4,41],"Tom is thought to have been likely"],[[4,43],"unarmed their friend Billy Claiborne was"],[[4,45],"also unarmed when the to posses met"],[[4,48],"face-to-face they were only a few feet"],[[4,50],"apart from one another"],[[4,51],"allegedly Virgil Earp warned the Cowboys"],[[4,54],"quote throw up your hands"],[[4,56],"I've come to disarm you end quote Billy"],[[4,59],"Clinton reportedly replied quote don't"],[[5,1],"shoot I don't want to fight end quote"],[[5,3],"Wyatt Earp came back with quote you sons"],[[5,6],"of bitches have been looking for a fight"],[[5,8],"and now you have it and quote it's"],[[5,11],"unclear who fired the first shot but"],[[5,13],"thirty seconds later Billy Clanton Tom"],[[5,15],"McLaury and Frank McLaury were mortally"],[[5,18],"wounded Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday were"],[[5,20],"charged with murder"],[[5,21],"testimonies differed and town people"],[[5,23],"were split over their allegiances"],[[5,25],"emblematic of the difficulties in"],[[5,27],"enforcing laws in the West all parties"],[[5,30],"were acquitted in time"],[[5,32],"urban holidays actions would even be"],[[5,34],"glorified as heroic well Shane this is a"],[[5,37],"pretty big moment for me I have always"],[[5,40],"been a fan of Old West history and right"],[[5,43],"now we are actually on the exact spot"],[[5,45],"where the infamous shootout at the OK"],[[5,47],"Corral happened that's a that's pretty"],[[5,50],"crazy we're walking through history"],[[5,51],"right I'm trying to contain my"],[[5,53],"excitement but this is a it's kind of"],[[5,55],"hard there's a boyish glee that washed"],[[5,56],"over me it's evident yeah I mean look at"],[[5,59],"that this is the exact positioning this"],[[6,0],"is based off of Wyatt Earp sketch it's"],[[6,3],"the only sketch from a participant of"],[[6,4],"the shootout that exists all right"],[[6,10],"my name is Ryan I'm Shane and we're here"],[[6,14],"just to find out what happened here"],[[6,16],"there's lots of different tellings of"],[[6,19],"how this went down you want to find out"],[[6,21],"the truth so if any of you fellows want"],[[6,23],"to tell us what actually happened here"],[[6,25],"particularly Billy Frank and Tom please"],[[6,30],"let us know now how did you die tell us"],[[6,33],"your side of the story why not what do"],[[6,36],"you got to say for yourself is that"],[[6,38],"thing broken you get buff

you right now"],[[6,57],"a little bit Hey what he got for us sir"],[[7,2],"yes the face I make when I hear the"],[[7,4],"spirit box - I get it about you with the"],[[7,7],"boyish face what do you got to say for"],[[7,10],"yourself"],[[7,11],"shave this morning densha on the day you"],[[7,13],"die well folks I think we've had our fun"],[[7,17],"here clearly none of you wanted to talk"],[[7,19],"to us and that's fine I got to stand in"],[[7,21],"history and that's enough for me maybe"],[[7,23],"I'll find something later I won't say"],[[7,25],"I'm not disappointed it has been an"],[[7,28],"honor to meet you sir he just gives you"],[[7,34],"a hug"],[[7,34],"okay don't smooch him while the herbs"],[[7,38],"escape the fight bloodied but alive the"],[[7,40],"actions of that October night would"],[[7,42],"follow them the rest of their lives on"],[[7,44],"December 28th 1881 eight weeks"],[[7,48],"after the gunfight Virgil was ambushed"],[[7,50],"as he was crossing the street he was"],[[7,52],"shot in the back with three rounds and"],[[7,55],"his left arm was shattered"],[[7,56],"Virgil survived but was permanently"],[[7,59],"disabled on March 18th 1882 about five"],[[8,3],"months after the gunfight Morgan Earp"],[[8,6],"was playing billiards in a saloon"],[[8,8],"only a block away from the OK Corral"],[[8,10],"from a darkened alley Morgan was shot in"],[[8,13],"the back by assassins within the hour"],[[8,16],"Morgan was dead they really don't like"],[[8,18],"these herbs well you know I mean that's"],[[8,20],"what happens when you feel like you

one's"],[[8,31],"impressed so here we are this is the"],[[8,33],"site where Morgan Earp was gunned down"],[[8,35],"while he was playing billiards obviously"],[[8,38],"this is continuing with the fallout of"],[[8,40],"the OK Corral shootout this was the"],[[8,42],"Cowboys revenge"],[[8,43],"they killed Morgan Earp in here in cold"],[[8,45],"blood on Wyatt Earp's buried there on"],[[8,48],"his

to"],[[17,46],"the silver mine shafts that ran beneath"],[[17,48],"town some believe these tunnels were the"],[[17,51],"work of this one"],[[17,52],"who according to the story would take"],[[17,54],"silver nuggets from the mines and bring"],[[17,56],"them back whatever happened to his cash"],[[17,59],"is unknown but some believe it may still"],[[18,1],"be hidden somewhere beneath big Kade"],[[18,3],"saloon apart from the treasure staff"],[[18,6],"tourists and locals alike claim that the"],[[18,8],"Swamper still wanders the dark corners"],[[18,10],"of the basement when employees explored"],[[18,13],"the tunnels they could hear moans of"],[[18,15],"distress echoing throughout the basement"],[[18,17],"though the building had been empty and"],[[18,19],"locked when they inflected to enter the"],[[18,21],"tunnels in general the basement is said"],[[18,23],"to be one of the most active areas of"],[[18,25],"the building as usual with the most"],[[18,28],"horrific parts

sunroom"],[[0,16],"which is like a smaller living room type"],[[0,18],"space which we use as a TV and movie"],[[0,20],"room there was also a door to the side"],[[0,22],"driveway in this room I had all the"],[[0,24],"blinds shut and was under a blanket and"],[[0,26],"watching some random movie I don't even"],[[0,28],"remember when out of nowhere the lights"],[[0,30],"turn on outside we have a motion sensing"],[[0,33],"light out there so the fact that it"],[[0,35],"turned on was concerning"],[[0,36],"I had to lower the volume on the TV to"],[[0,39],"listen up for any possible sounds it was"],[[0,41],"unlikely I'd hear anything from outside"],[[0,43],"though so I lifted the blinds briefly"],[[0,45],"just to do a quick check it was clear"],[[0,48],"there was no way that I know of to shut"],[[0,50],"off that light so as annoying as it was"],[[0,52],"I just had to wait I figured it was a"],[[0,56],"raccoon or a possum or something that"],[[0,58],"might have triggered the light though"],[[1,0],"the more I thought about it the less"],[[1,1],"that made sense so I put on my shoes and"],[[1,4],"just walked around the driveway to ease"],[[1,5],"my mind no one was there so I could go"],[[1,8],"back to watching TV with a clear head"],[[1,11],"some time passed and I suddenly heard a"],[[1,13],"bucket full of something fall over"],[[1,15],"outside and then the motion sensing"],[[1,17],"light turned back on the first time it"],[[1,19],"happened I was concerned but now I was"],[[1,22],"straight-up scared someone or something"],[[1,24],"was out there I was hoping it was an"],[[1,26],"animal but I really started to doubt it"],[[1,29],"I didn't want to get up because the"],[[1,31],"couch was actually the only blind spot"],[[1,33],"from the door to the side and I had a"],[[1,35],"fear of getting up and seeing somebody"],[[1,37],"standing at that door"],[[1,38],"I wanted to shut the TV now but the"],[[1,41],"remote was in the middle of the coffee"],[[1,42],"table and I was afraid to even move that"],[[1,44],"much I looked to the blinds which were"],[[1,47],"fully pulled shut however I wasn't"],[[1,49],"looking at the blinds I was looking at"],[[1,52],"what I saw through the blinds"],[[1,54],"there was a perfect outline of a person"],[[1,57],"standing on the other side but their"],[[1,58],"arms stretched out a bit from their body"],[[2,1],"I don't know how to describe in writing"],[[2,3],"how I felt in that moment there was an"],[[2,5],"intense feeling in my heart and stomach"],[[2,6],"area and I felt like it was harder to"],[[2,8],"breathe"],[[2,9],"that's how scared I was I got up from"],[[2,12],"the couch as quietly as I could but"],[[2,14],"before I could even get to the door that"],[[2,15],"separates the sunroom and the dining"],[[2,17],"room the person on the other end started"],[[2,19],"knocking aggressively on the window I"],[[2,21],"wanted to scare them away somehow I was"],[[2,24],"too scared to go out there so I screamed"],[[2,26],"in a shaky voice and calling the cops I"],[[2,29],"stood by the doorway for a second to see"],[[2,31],"if they stopped and they did but I saw"],[[2,34],"the shadow beyond the blinds move"],[[2,36],"towards the door I saw some old crazy"],[[2,38],"looking woman with wiry hair on the"],[[2,40],"other side of the door for a moment I"],[[2,42],"felt less intimidated and so she started"],[[2,44],"banging on the glass of my door with"],[[2,46],"both hands screaming as if she were"],[[2,48],"mental I slammed the door to the sunroom"],[[2,52],"and called 911"],[[2,54],"did some crazy mental old woman"],[[2,56],"attempting to break into my house I was"],[[3,0],"told to wait in a safe locked room with"],[[3,1],"a weapon to defend myself until the"],[[3,3],"police arrived and you nightmare I ever"],[[3,6],"had about a break-in came true when I"],[[3,8],"heard glass shattering outside of the"],[[3,10],"bathroom I waited a minute after not"],[[3,13],"hearing anything too slowly and quietly"],[[3,15],"unlock and open the bathroom door"],[[3,18],"I peered into my living room and there"],[[3,20],"she was the old woman with the wiry hair"],[[3,23],"standing in the middle of my living room"],[[3,25],"in front of a broken window she spotted"],[[3,28],"me when I had the door open and came"],[[3,30],"rushing over to the door I screamed like"],[[3,33],"the scared seventeen-year-old I was and"],[[3,35],"slammed the door shut again the old"],[[3,38],"woman started knocking on the door and"],[[3,39],"wouldn't stop she was saying things"],[[3,42],"under her breath on the other side and I"],[[3,44],"could make out any of it it was too busy"],[[3,46],"crying and begging her to go away I"],[[3,49],"finally heard a bang at the front door"],[[3,51],"so I opened the bathroom window and"],[[3,52],"screamed help two cops came up to the"],[[3,55],"window I was screaming through and had"],[[3,57],"begged them to crawl through the broken"],[[3,58],"window out back they assured me they'd"],[[4,1],"be okay and they'll be right here the"],[[4,3],"knocking at the door stopped and the"],[[4,5],"sudden commotion was taking place"],[[4,6],"outside I heard the two cops scream at"],[[4,9],"the woman to step away from the door"],[[4,11],"when I stepped out from the bathroom the"],[[4,13],"two cops had the insane woman detained"],[[4,15],"I'd imagine they did it pretty easily"],[[4,17],"the woman looked at me with a look of"],[[4,20],"crazy in her eyes and I looked away it"],[[4,23],"turned out the old woman who lived in a"],[[4,25],"nearby house with some woman who never"],[[4,26],"leaves the house none of the neighbors"],[[4,28],"ever really see her the old woman was"],[[4,31],"messed up in multiple ways and belonged"],[[4,33],"in some kind of special care place my"],[[4,36],"parents pressed charges on the younger"],[[4,37],"woman because they felt as her supposed"],[[4,39],"to caretaker she should have been held"],[[4,41],"liable for allowing a mentally disabled"],[[4,43],"person to break into someone else's"],[[4,44],"house sadly my parents lost the lawsuit"],[[4,48],"but the old crazy woman was out of our"],[[4,50],"neighborhood at the very least it was"],[[4,52],"put in some kind of treatment center"],[[5,4],"I own a small house on a big property in"],[[5,7],"the rural part of New York and I go up"],[[5,9],"there a bunch of times a year in the"],[[5,10],"winter months to go skiing"],[[5,12],"there's a neighbor up there that I never"],[[5,14],"spoken to once there's a fence that"],[[5,16],"separates our two yards then on the"],[[5,19],"other sides of my house is woods for"],[[5,20],"miles there's another neighbor further"],[[5,23],"down the road across the street and I'd"],[[5,25],"met him a number of times because he"],[[5,26],"happens to go skiing too so he got to"],[[5,28],"know each other based off that I went up"],[[5,31],"this past January for the first time in"],[[5,33],"the season as I walked up to the front"],[[5,35],"door I heard a kid laughing nearby in"],[[5,38],"the neighbor's houses direction I"],[[5,40],"figured they had kids which was news to"],[[5,42],"me stepping into the house for the first"],[[5,45],"time each season was always weird a"],[[5,47],"house that would be empty for a majority"],[[5,49],"of the year so I'd had to turn on the"],[[5,51],"water and he'd and everything of course"],[[5,54],"the first night I slept like a baby"],[[5,57],"after the four-hour drive from"],[[5,58],"Connecticut the next morning after"],[[6,0],"eating breakfast and changing into my"],[[6,2],"ski gear I went outside and found a big"],[[6,4],"red ball sitting in the snow on my front"],[[6,6],"lawn wasn't there the day before so I"],[[6,9],"assumed it belonged to the neighbors I"],[[6,11],"took the ball and threw it over the"],[[6,13],"fence separating our properties then I"],[[6,16],"went off to the ski lodge to meet my"],[[6,18],"friend and we spent the day skiing when"],[[6,22],"I got back it was dark out I'd eaten"],[[6,24],"dinner with my friends so I was ready to"],[[6,25],"go to bed walking to the front door I"],[[6,28],"noticed that once again that big red"],[[6,30],"ball was sitting on my front lawn Howie"],[[6,34],"was getting a bit odd but once again I"],[[6,36],"threw that red ball over the fence I"],[[6,38],"woke up in the middle of that night to"],[[6,40],"laughing outside a kids laughter it was"],[[6,44],"like 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. a kid playing"],[[6,47],"outside made no sense I went to look out"],[[6,50],"my window I couldn't see any kids though"],[[6,52],"and now the laughter had stopped however"],[[6,56],"I did see something sitting on my front"],[[6,57],"lawn I couldn't tell from the window so"],[[7,0],"I went outside into the snow and my"],[[7,2],"slippers and robe and saw that red ball"],[[7,4],"once again sitting in the snow I got"],[[7,7],"chills as I saw it in the same spot once"],[[7,9],"again I took the ball and this time"],[[7,12],"instead of throwing it over the fence I"],[[7,14],"brought it inside my house I went back"],[[7,17],"to sleep not hearing any laughter"],[[7,18],"outside again that night the next"],[[7,21],"morning before going skiing again I"],[[7,23],"walked over to the neighbor's house"],[[7,24],"knocked on the door and finally"],[[7,26],"introduced myself surprisingly he was an"],[[7,29],"elderly man who seemed completely"],[[7,31],"innocent"],[[7,31],"I questioned the child's laughter I kept"],[[7,34],"hearing and the ball that kept ending up"],[[7,36],"on my lawn he told me there were no kids"],[[7,39],"around there I got chills again I"],[[7,42],"thanked him shook his hand and went back"],[[7,44],"to my house"],[[7,45],"I left the red ball in my living room"],[[7,47],"that drove back up the mountain and had"],[[7,49],"another day of skiing with my friend"],[[7,51],"when I got back to the house that night"],[[7,53],"I was completely exhausted and ready to"],[[7,55],"go home the next day I threw all my"],[[7,58],"stuff on the couch and figured I'd pack"],[[8,0],"it all up tomorrow it literally crashed"],[[8,3],"into the bed as my whole body was sore"],[[8,5],"and I fell asleep like a baby"],[[8,8],"except I woke up to a kids laughter"],[[8,10],"outside again I jumped out of bed and"],[[8,14],"ran to the window to look outside there"],[[8,18],"was the red ball sitting in the snow"],[[8,19],"again I ran to the living room into"],[[8,22],"where the room upside down looking for"],[[8,24],"the ball I still know to this day I'd"],[[8,27],"left it in there when I left"],[[8,28],"but it wasn't there now I suddenly"],[[8,31],"didn't feel alone in the house I turned"],[[8,34],"on every light as I packed up all my wet"],[[8,36],"gear into my bag I threw everything in"],[[8,39],"the bag so I'd be ready to go if"],[[8,41],"hit the fan"],[[8,41],"I made sure all the doors and windows"],[[8,44],"were locked and they were so it made no"],[[8,47],"sense"],[[8,48],"I left the lights on and went back to my"],[[8,50],"room shutting off only those lights I"],[[8,53],"looked out the window and far behind the"],[[8,55],"red ball I would in the snow was what"],[[8,58],"looked like a kid a kid just standing"],[[9,0],"stiff looking towards my window I ducked"],[[9,4],"down and closed the blinds I closed the"],[[9,6],"blinds to every window in my house I"],[[9,8],"tried my best to just go to sleep and"],[[9,10],"ignore it it was a long hour before my"],[[9,14],"exhaustion overcame my fear and I fell"],[[9,16],"asleep I woke up the next morning"],[[9,19],"skipped breakfast"],[[9,20],"packed up the car and spent the hell"],[[9,22],"away from there not looking back to the"],[[9,24],"red ball that was still on my front lawn"],[[9,27],"I've never had anything to be stolen in"],[[9,29],"that house so I was ok with leaving and"],[[9,32],"in this situation either way I can't"],[[9,35],"figure out how whoever was out there got"],[[9,36],"into my house to take the ball out in"],[[9,38],"the first place"],[[9,39],"and that child's laughter still haunts"],[[9,42],"me but the scariest part of the whole"],[[9,44],"experience was seeing that child"],[[9,46],"standing outside in the cold snow in the"],[[9,48],"middle of the night had that ball not"],[[9,50],"been taken out of my living room somehow"],[[9,52],"this whole thing would be different but"],[[9,54],"because of that I don't know what to"],[[9,56],"think"],[[10,5],"my roommate George and I met through"],[[10,8],"work we live 15 minutes from the office"],[[10,10],"and carpool together every day to get"],[[10,13],"right into it recently we got a new"],[[10,15],"neighbor as recent as two weeks ago"],[[10,17],"actually we didn't see him unpacking or"],[[10,20],"anything we never even saw what he"],[[10,22],"looked like you didn't even know if he"],[[10,24],"was a man or a woman or how many people"],[[10,26],"moved in but I say he because obviously"],[[10,29],"we found out eventually so on the third"],[[10,32],"day George and I actually went next door"],[[10,34],"to introduce ourselves but he didn't"],[[10,37],"answer the door he was home his car was"],[[10,39],"in the driveway we figured maybe he just"],[[10,42],"couldn't answer it for whatever reason"],[[10,44],"as we were walking back down the"],[[10,46],"driveway George stopped me and told me"],[[10,49],"under his breath to look at the window"],[[10,50],"next to the front door I looked and saw"],[[10,53],"a kink in the blinds a man was holding"],[[10,55],"it up and staring through it like a"],[[10,57],"creep George and I looked at each other"],[[11,0],"and kept walking a dream that was both"],[[11,2],"insanely awkward and creepy now we knew"],[[11,4],"already he was not going to be the best"],[[11,6],"of neighbors that night at around 1:00"],[[11,9],"in the morning I just started hearing"],[[11,11],"noises coming from outside it's warm"],[[11,14],"where we live year round so the windows"],[[11,16],"are always open I went to go look"],[[11,19],"outside and my room is upstairs so it"],[[11,21],"kind of overlooks the neighbor's"],[[11,22],"backyard which was where the sound was"],[[11,24],"coming from"],[[11,25],"I saw the neighbor he was some big"],[[11,28],"looking guy wearing a hoodie with the"],[[11,30],"hood up which was weird given that it"],[[11,32],"was like 72 degrees out and he was"],[[11,34],"sawing a big piece of wood it was a"],[[11,37],"ridiculous scene I went to go knock on"],[[11,40],"George's door apparently he was already"],[[11,42],"awake for the noise too he had work"],[[11,45],"early the next morning and what this guy"],[[11,47],"was doing at this hour was nuts and it"],[[11,49],"went on for some time we agreed to go"],[[11,52],"over and ask him politely to stop since"],[[11,55],"he was outside we knocked on the gate"],[[11,57],"instead of the door just as we did the"],[[12,0],"song stopped he expected the gate to"],[[12,2],"open any second but it never did"],[[12,5],"at least the song stopped though so we"],[[12,7],"went back to sleep"],[[12,10],"it wasn't until a few nights later that"],[[12,13],"we heard noises in the middle of the"],[[12,14],"night again I woke up but couldn't"],[[12,17],"figure out what the sounds were right"],[[12,18],"away not until I got to the window and"],[[12,21],"realized the sounds were screams"],[[12,24],"screaming seems to be coming from inside"],[[12,26],"the house next door and I saw the"],[[12,28],"neighbor outside in his backyard again"],[[12,30],"he was hurrying into his house but he"],[[12,32],"was dragging something I couldn't tell"],[[12,34],"what then he stopped and looked up at my"],[[12,37],"window and moved away from the window as"],[[12,40],"soon as I realized I ran to George's"],[[12,42],"door he was already awake for the noises"],[[12,45],"too he got on the phone with the police"],[[12,47],"right away to report this I stood right"],[[12,50],"by his door away the whole time"],[[12,51],"listening then there was a slam from"],[[12,54],"downstairs"],[[12,55],"it was our back door we looked at each"],[[12,58],"other with horrified looks on her faces"],[[13,0],"George yelled into the phone to send"],[[13,2],"help because the man just entered our"],[[13,4],"house"],[[13,5],"while he stayed on the phone with the"],[[13,7],"cops I went to the hallway and then to"],[[13,9],"the stairway I looked down the stairs"],[[13,11],"and listened"],[[13,12],"there was creaking the floorboards down"],[[13,15],"there I tiptoed back to George's room"],[[13,17],"and shut the door he told the woman on"],[[13,20],"the line so had the police come in"],[[13,21],"through the back to her immediately and"],[[13,23],"then hung up there's no lock on his door"],[[13,26],"so we pushed up against the door in case"],[[13,28],"god forbid the man tried to open it I"],[[13,31],"heard footsteps coming up the stairs"],[[13,33],"fast and the bathroom door opened"],[[13,36],"footsteps then moved quickly to George's"],[[13,38],"door we began to push as hard as we"],[[13,40],"could the man tried pushing the door"],[[13,42],"open ramming it and then hitting it with"],[[13,45],"some kind of blunt object and that was"],[[13,47],"the exact reason we didn't try to"],[[13,48],"overpower him we didn't know what kind"],[[13,50],"of weapons he could have no matter what"],[[13,53],"he did though he couldn't push through"],[[13,54],"the door we heard him go downstairs and"],[[13,57],"all was quiet a few minutes passed and"],[[14,0],"we finally decided to open the door and"],[[14,2],"peek outside it wasn't in the hallway"],[[14,5],"suddenly we heard a man shall police and"],[[14,8],"a deep commanding voice George and I ran"],[[14,11],"downstairs and relief when we got there"],[[14,13],"we didn't see any police I noticed right"],[[14,16],"away however that someone was hiding"],[[14,18],"behind our dining room table I told"],[[14,21],"George to run back upstairs with me and"],[[14,24],"the man hiding behind the table got up"],[[14,25],"and chased us up the stairs"],[[14,27],"this time we went to the bathroom where"],[[14,29],"we could at least lock the door but we"],[[14,31],"weren't in there for long because once"],[[14,32],"again we heard someone shout police"],[[14,34],"downstairs this time for real the man"],[[14,37],"banging on the door stops and there was"],[[14,39],"silence upstairs George and I screamed"],[[14,42],"up here up here and the two police"],[[14,44],"officers came up the stairs yelling at"],[[14,46],"the man to drop his weapon we heard the"],[[14,49],"sound of a knife being dropped to the"],[[14,50],"floor"],[[14,50],"and when the police told us to come out"],[[14,52],"we did it brought him out to the police"],[[14,55],"car in cuffs and put him in the backseat"],[[14,58],"he told the officers to check his house"],[[15,0],"because we heard screams they went in"],[[15,3],"with guns drawn as another cop car"],[[15,4],"pulled up in front of our house and then"],[[15,6],"two more cop cars pulled up two minutes"],[[15,8],"later we were shocked to see the cops"],[[15,11],"come out of the house with a woman"],[[15,12],"crying hysterically she had been locked"],[[15,14],"in his basement and she was pressed up"],[[15,16],"against the door screaming as loud as"],[[15,18],"she could there was also a dead body in"],[[15,20],"the bag the men had been

This unadorned tart bakes at a fairly high temperature and boasts a deeply browned crisp crust. The apples at the bottom of the tart are insulated from direct heat, so they steam and soften into a very tender layer. The ones up top hold their shape, which means you’ll get a mix of textures in each bite.\r\n\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://bonappetit.com/recipe/naked-a...\n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nABOUT BON APPÉTIT\r\nCook with confidence using Bon Appetit’s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.

film from this side because"],[[0,2],"I forgot to put this earring back in"],[[0,4],"this morning cuz I've slept on it and it"],[[0,6],"was okay and just like do this for the"],[[0,10],"rest of the day hey guys it's Kyle I'm"],[[0,17],"here in the BA test kitchen and today"],[[0,19],"I'm going to make my favorite method for"],[[0,21],"making pastry dough which has no special"],[[0,24],"equipment no food processor and doesn't"],[[0,27],"get messed up and then we're gonna take"],[[0,28],"that dough and make a super rustic apple"],[[0,31],"tart where you don't even peel the"],[[0,33],"apples because why why so super simple"],[[0,38],"all-purpose flour a little bit of salt"],[[0,42],"sugar toss toss just use your your use"],[[0,46],"your hands and then with one of these"],[[0,48],"handy-dandy bench scrapers which I'm"],[[0,50],"gonna use throughout the whole dough"],[[0,52],"making process this is four ounces half"],[[0,54],"a cup of unsalted butter"],[[0,56],"so again just using my hands I'm tossing"],[[0,59],"the butter into the flour mixture and"],[[1,2],"I'm doing that just to coat the outside"],[[1,4],"of these cubes they're gonna want to"],[[1,6],"stick anyway but this way it's kind of"],[[1,9],"like a little bit of insulation okay"],[[1,12],"don't need the cutting board again get"],[[1,14],"that out of there and now another part"],[[1,17],"that I really enjoy is just dumping it"],[[1,19],"right onto the work surface normal"],[[1,21],"pastry dough recipes at this point would"],[[1,23],"tell you to either smash the butter in"],[[1,26],"with your hands or use a pastry cutter"],[[1,28],"to do it this is a little bit different"],[[1,30],"I have a little extra flour here I'm"],[[1,33],"gonna flour the pin instead of cutting"],[[1,36],"the butter into the flour I'm going to"],[[1,38],"roll the butter into the flour and what"],[[1,41],"happens here is that instead of making"],[[1,43],"little pea-sized bits it creates these"],[[1,47],"long sheets so this point I have my"],[[1,49],"sheets of butter they're coated in flour"],[[1,51],"I'm just gonna put everything back into"],[[1,54],"the bowl and when you get a little bit"],[[1,56],"more comfortable with this method you"],[[1,58],"can stay on the work surface but it is"],[[2,1],"nice at this point to kind of be"],[[2,3],"contained and this is a little extra but"],[[2,7],"we need three tablespoons of ice water"],[[2,11],"take a fork really just tossing this"],[[2,13],"through I'm not really I'm not trying to"],[[2,15],"do anything with the butter at this"],[[2,16],"stage I'm just trying to distribute that"],[[2,21],"liquid okay so now the moisture has been"],[[2,25],"absorbed or at least distributed so now"],[[2,28],"I'm just rolling it out and it's not"],[[2,30],"supposed to hold together at this point"],[[2,31],"it seems a little bit weird but I'm"],[[2,33],"gonna try to fold the dough onto itself"],[[2,36],"like you would fold a letter into thirds"],[[2,38],"I always start at the top start at the"],[[2,40],"bottom whatever works and just kind of"],[[2,42],"flipping it's not folding I'm just"],[[2,46],"scared of like getting everybody to go"],[[2,48],"to the middle and then starting from the"],[[2,50],"other end and folding up and over but"],[[2,53],"like I said this is a pile of like"],[[2,54],"rubble at this point so don't be weirded"],[[2,56],"out that you don't have dough yet it"],[[2,58],"takes a couple of times and then I just"],[[3,1],"use a straight edge again get everybody"],[[3,3],"back together into a little rectangle"],[[3,6],"using the thing smush it over and just"],[[3,11],"kind of be light I'm like trying not to"],[[3,13],"touch it too much with my hands and then"],[[3,15],"same thing again alright so this is the"],[[3,19],"third time usually when I make this"],[[3,21],"dough that's all it takes but what I can"],[[3,24],"see is that like most of it on the"],[[3,28],"surface has that creamy look of like in"],[[3,31],"an emulsified dough I'm gonna fold it"],[[3,33],"one more time and I'm using my hands to"],[[3,37],"form it into a desk okay if it looks a"],[[3,40],"little drier than does that give me in"],[[3,43],"the past"],[[3,43],"just trust well it sits in the fridge at"],[[3,47],"this point plastic I almost called it"],[[3,51],"clasp clasp dip plastic taking a sheet"],[[3,57],"of plastic wrap and you can actually use"],[[4,1],"the plastic wrap to help gather it"],[[4,3],"without worrying about smashing it down"],[[4,8],"too much so half an hour see you later"],[[4,12],"Stingo Xango I want to frisbee this I"],[[4,15],"know it's not right so I'll just be"],[[4,17],"normal"],[[4,18],"Oh Rhoda's ready okay hold on we're"],[[4,22],"gonna UFO this desk"],[[4,24],"did you play ultimate fling yay cold"],[[4,31],"dough is easier to roll out"],[[4,33],"it also has rested so the gluten isn't"],[[4,35],"so activated and the butter is nice and"],[[4,39],"chilled back down and I'm not gonna get"],[[4,41],"as much sticking and smashing you don't"],[[4,43],"need to go crazy on the flowering but I"],[[4,45],"also don't think there's any great"],[[4,47],"advantage to like under flowering to"],[[4,50],"like you're not don't be a hero you know"],[[4,52],"what I mean give yourself and give the"],[[4,54],"dough the flower that it needs to not"],[[4,55],"stick Chris Morocco taught me turn the"],[[4,59],"dough 90 degrees you guys know Chris"],[[5,1],"Morocco I used to complain why why Chris"],[[5,4],"Morocco"],[[5,5],"why does my dough want to split at the"],[[5,7],"edges so much and he said you know"],[[5,10],"turning it 90 degree is like every other"],[[5,12],"pass of the pin is not overkill I"],[[5,15],"started doing that I did notice an"],[[5,17],"improvement in my cracks around my edges"],[[5,20],"we're using this this is called a"],[[5,22],"removable bottom fluted tart pan and I'm"],[[5,26],"going out to about an eighth of an inch"],[[5,29],"thick alright there's a couple of"],[[5,32],"different ways to get the dough into the"],[[5,35],"pan the method that I like the most is"],[[5,37],"just to take the dough and roll it on to"],[[5,41],"the pin being mindful now not to like"],[[5,44],"press down on the pin because that would"],[[5,47],"smush the dough together and just kind"],[[5,49],"of getting all the way to the end brush"],[[5,51],"as much of it as possible onto your"],[[5,53],"shirt as you go and then instead of"],[[5,57],"bringing the dough to the tart pan bring"],[[5,59],"the tart pan to the dough all right so"],[[6,2],"now you're just going to unroll leaving"],[[6,6],"like leave a lot of slack right you"],[[6,9],"don't want to do this tightly because"],[[6,11],"you want to be able to pick the dough up"],[[6,13],"and push it into the pan starting at one"],[[6,16],"edge kind of just lifting it up and"],[[6,19],"pressing it down so that I call this"],[[6,21],"where the where the floor meets the"],[[6,23],"walls there's good contact I'm just"],[[6,26],"using this like flat part of my knuckle"],[[6,28],"take the rolling pin again and I'm going"],[[6,30],"to use this just a zipper across the"],[[6,33],"dough so now I do want to press down"],[[6,35],"and it's like a giant cookie cutter but"],[[6,37],"from upside-down feels pretty good so"],[[6,43],"and then you get this little skirt of"],[[6,46],"dough so now I'm gonna let the dough"],[[6,49],"chill again just because I have to make"],[[6,50],"the filling anyway first thing just"],[[6,55],"because the butter takes a few minutes"],[[6,56],"to brown I'm just gonna get that started"],[[6,58],"half a stick of butter I'm using my"],[[7,0],"hands for everything today it might be a"],[[7,3],"little bit more than I need but I'd"],[[7,6],"rather have enough to brush around so"],[[7,9],"it's already half melted starting to"],[[7,12],"foam if you like making caramel and kind"],[[7,15],"of watching that magical process of"],[[7,17],"something turning from one thing into"],[[7,18],"another then you will also like making"],[[7,21],"brown butter a lot of excitement in the"],[[7,26],"butter a little bit of swirling and then"],[[7,31],"you can kind of smell it at the moment"],[[7,33],"that it goes from golden to brown and I"],[[7,37],"just want to pull it here it's gonna"],[[7,40],"continue to brown a little bit going"],[[7,43],"slowly I have a few pink lady apples why"],[[7,46],"do I like a pink lady so glad you asked"],[[7,49],"pink ladies are consistent they're"],[[7,52],"available everywhere they hold their"],[[7,53],"shape when they cook they are a good"],[[7,55],"combination of sweet and tart they are"],[[7,57],"crispy but they're not too firm like a"],[[7,59],"Honey Crisp which you bake with it's"],[[8,1],"just like really stays all together so a"],[[8,3],"pink lady is a great apple they"],[[8,5],"definitely do want to core them alright"],[[8,7],"so just using the apple core Wow"],[[8,14],"it's quite a core was a little"],[[8,17],"off-center I think I'm realizing right"],[[8,19],"now as we do this I don't own an apple"],[[8,21],"corer so what I usually do at home is"],[[8,24],"dumb and takes an extra step but I just"],[[8,28],"slice it and then I go back through and"],[[8,30],"maybe I use a spoon or a paring knife to"],[[8,33],"take the cores out this is more"],[[8,35],"efficient but you can tell it basically"],[[8,38],"never done it before this is the other"],[[8,41],"part where you like wow I think it's"],[[8,47],"very dull it's not me and I want to"],[[8,51],"slice these crosswise into rounds and I"],[[8,54],"don't want to cut these super thin that"],[[8,58],"might be pushing it a little bit that's"],[[9,0],"like a quarter of an inch I'm gonna try"],[[9,2],"to go a little thinner than that"],[[9,4],"they look like googly eyes I hate"],[[9,7],"Halloween to be perfectly honest with"],[[9,9],"you I saw my favorite holiday I don't"],[[9,12],"know one year I got egged that wasn't"],[[9,15],"fun another I'm afraid of the masks the"],[[9,18],"scream mask is so scary to me I just"],[[9,21],"kind of get really nervous and then and"],[[9,23],"then as a parent it's like a nightmare"],[[9,25],"because you're basically in an eternal"],[[9,28],"struggle about how much candy am I gonna"],[[9,30],"get this is a lot of apples probably"],[[9,32],"more than we needed there probably could"],[[9,34],"have stopped after three probably maybe"],[[9,37],"because it's this many apples this isn't"],[[9,39],"quite enough sugar this is all fine the"],[[9,44],"sugar is gonna help browning it's not"],[[9,45],"enough to really add like a ton of"],[[9,47],"sweetness and that's that pinch of salt"],[[9,50],"I was talking about and this is a juice"],[[9,52],"of half a lemon which will be I don't"],[[9,56],"know a couple tablespoons"],[[10,0],"and that's for flavor not just it's"],[[10,2],"gonna help the apples not turn brown now"],[[10,6],"all that's left to do is get the apples"],[[10,7],"into the pan and the only layer that"],[[10,11],"really counts is the very top so for the"],[[10,14],"bottom I want to get them kind of close"],[[10,17],"together so that there's nice layers and"],[[10,19],"the finished tart all right I think it"],[[10,22],"looks pretty good I think it's gonna"],[[10,24],"look pretty later"],[[10,25],"here's that brown butter and the milk"],[[10,27],"solids inevitably are gonna have fallen"],[[10,30],"to the bottom I'm so stir it up as you"],[[10,32],"go you get some of these flecks which"],[[10,35],"looks a little bit like vanilla but it's"],[[10,36],"not vanilla and while this cooks the"],[[10,39],"juices are going to come out the juices"],[[10,41],"are gonna mingle with the brown butter"],[[10,42],"they're gonna make a new flavor together"],[[10,45],"they're going even toastier"],[[10,47],"and now I'm just brushing a little bit"],[[10,49],"on the edge of the dough as well it'll"],[[10,51],"give it a little shine the gone this"],[[10,58],"amount of butter was kind of perfect I'm"],[[10,59],"gonna leave the tiniest bit so that when"],[[11,3],"the tart comes out of the oven I can"],[[11,4],"brush it with a little butter and give a"],[[11,5],"little shine at the end so this is going"],[[11,11],"into a 400 degree oven which I believe"],[[11,14],"is ready over here"],[[11,21],"and I'm gonna set a timer for one hour"],[[11,25],"all right one hour has elapsed I'm gonna"],[[11,28],"check on my tart"],[[11,29],"it looks pretty perfect all right so a"],[[11,37],"couple of things that I'm looking for to"],[[11,38],"make sure it's done I want to see deep"],[[11,42],"golden-brown color all the way around"],[[11,44],"the crust the apples on top got really"],[[11,46],"nice color and then just pressing and"],[[11,49],"looking at the ones on the bottom layer"],[[11,51],"I can tell that they're totally tender"],[[11,53],"so it's a perfect time to take it out of"],[[11,55],"the oven so now I'm taking just that"],[[12,2],"tiny bit of residual brown butter that I"],[[12,5],"held back from before and while the tart"],[[12,7],"is still warm"],[[12,9],"I just want to dab just a little dab"],[[12,12],"over the apples to shine them up this"],[[12,17],"butter will soak right in so if you"],[[12,20],"don't have the patience to wait for your"],[[12,21],"tart to cool or even if you do either"],[[12,23],"way this is a good trick so that you're"],[[12,25],"not doing this with the tart in your"],[[12,28],"hand take a bowl regular ordinary Bowl"],[[12,32],"turn it over take your pan just Center"],[[12,38],"it and the ring drops away it was sounds"],[[12,46],"flaky a couple of things I want to show"],[[12,49],"you one is look at the underside of the"],[[12,53],"crust can you guys see that that's"],[[12,56],"because I pressed it really well against"],[[12,58],"a tart bottom and got good contact good"],[[13,2],"heat conductivity 400 degree oven really"],[[13,5],"good color on the bottom there she is"],[[13,7],"beautiful rustic ring of apple tart I"],[[13,11],"hope that you try this try the dough let"],[[13,14],"me know how it goes kind of like"],[[13,15],"blueberry pie I really love seeing"],[[13,18],"pictures of all the pies and stuff that"],[[13,20],"you guys come up with"],[[13,21],"so it's apple picking season it's fall"],[[13,24],"it's late fall it's almost Thanksgiving"],[[13,27],"please make rustic apple tart and let me"],[[13,29],"know how it goes"],[[13,29],"so I'm feeling very PI proud right now"],[[13,33],"or tart proud I should say so let's just"],[[13,35],"get a slice and we can see the different"],[[13,37],"layers all crunchy get a nice little"],[[13,41],"slice and this little crispy edges felt"],[[13,45],"awesome mmm mmm it's good it's very"],[[13,49],"flaky it's really crunchy you can take a"],[[13,53],"little bit of creme fraiche sour cream"],[[13,55],"would work to just get a little dollop"],[[13,57],"going flaky layers of dough many"],[[14,0],"different layers of apples really soft"],[[14,3],"tender ones on the underside really nice"],[[14,5],"firm kind of roasty-toasty guys on the"],[[14,7],"top side I feel like I should try it"],[[14,16],"mmm-hmm another benefit of a tart you"],[[14,22],"can eat it warm pie you have to wait and"],[[14,26],"wait and wait and wait for it to cool"],[[14,27],"down the chart you just get into right"],[[14,30],"away recommend"],[[14,41],"next have a few"],[[14,46],"[Laughter]"],[[14,51],"you got to be in Fanshawe yeah

and"],[[1,27],"feminism but she's the cool thing she"],[[1,28],"did she involved men in the conversation"],[[1,29],"so well and I was like the we did that"],[[1,31],"is so great cuz when I do that like a"],[[1,33],"lot of guys are just like shut up then"],[[1,35],"she did it with such grace is very did"],[[1,37],"the same with veganism on our show you"],[[1,38],"know if you can somehow your new Watson"],[[1,40],"be kind of persuasive the best ways to"],[[1,41],"involve people in conversation she does"],[[1,43],"us so well exactly"],[[1,44],"so as we touched on in your intro you've"],[[1,46],"been one of the biggest stars in the"],[[1,47],"internet for the better part of a decade"],[[1,49],"racking up billions of views tens of"],[[1,51],"millions of subscribers and hitting a"],[[1,53],"couple of Forbes lists along the way"],[[1,54],"what role did a hot ones alum and friend"],[[1,57],"of the brand Harley Morenstein play and"],[[1,59],"helping you level up I got us a great"],[[2,1],"question so when I was starting YouTube"],[[2,3],"I was a complete loner and loser and"],[[2,5],"nerd and I knew nothing about it you"],[[2,6],"know I was living in Toronto and"],[[2,7],"everyone else was in LA and in the"],[[2,9],"industry and in in the heart of it all I"],[[2,11],"slid into Sdn like a Harley you know I"],[[2,14],"love if you could educate me a little"],[[2,15],"bit on the YouTube game"],[[2,16],"it wasn't even creepy or weird he wasn't"],[[2,18],"even trying to go there he just sat down"],[[2,21],"with me and just educated me on"],[[2,22],"everything related to the game and his"],[[2,23],"conversation is actually what prompted"],[[2,26],"me to take YouTube seriously and make it"],[[2,27],"a career so I owe a lot of my success to"],[[2,29],"Harley shout-out to Harley and beard"],[[2,31],"goals yeah for sure cannot mine you know"],[[2,33],"like not very completely well if you"],[[2,35],"need something you'll see you like don't"],[[2,37],"but you'll see like a little bit but I'm"],[[2,39],"working on it so you know and then in"],[[2,41],"the entertainment industry across the"],[[2,43],"board but particularly in YouTube"],[[2,45],"there's this spotlight on mental health"],[[2,47],"because there's this pressure to deliver"],[[2,49],"so consistently and then you're met with"],[[2,51],"all this immediate feedback right do you"],[[2,53],"feel the same pressure with every upload"],[[2,55],"to please your audience or does that"],[[2,56],"ease over time absolutely i I know the"],[[3,0],"ends are people one here is like you get"],[[3,2],"thick skin and yeah you get thick skin"],[[3,4],"when it comes to hate comments and stuff"],[[3,6],"but every uploads kind of like people"],[[3,8],"don't like this one it stresses me out"],[[3,9],"will get as much abuse as the last one"],[[3,10],"and it's weird because you're self aware"],[[3,13],"that it's not healthy but you know that"],[[3,16],"measure"],[[3,16],"your success by views is not healthy so"],[[3,18],"some of the lessons I've had to teach"],[[3,19],"myself is views don't define me"],[[3,21],"subscribers don't define me and just say"],[[3,23],"that okay / and I'll hit 15 million I'll"],[[3,25],"be like just hit 15 in subscribers so"],[[3,28],"it's like you're self-aware but you"],[[3,30],"still make bad choices I'm gonna front"],[[3,35],"for as long as I can I can see the"],[[3,37],"strength in your eyes it's good so your"],[[3,46],"list of collaborations is impressive to"],[[3,48],"say the least talk and first world"],[[3,49],"problems with Bill Gates having a dinner"],[[3,52],"date in Hawaii with the rock and then"],[[3,53],"playing iPhone games with Michelle Obama"],[[3,55],"and here in the hot ones we know"],[[3,57],"firsthand how hard it is to target a"],[[3,59],"high profile celebrity and then get them"],[[4,1],"to agree right to eat the wings of death"],[[4,3],"here when you think about all the times"],[[4,4],"you had to go above and beyond and"],[[4,6],"hustle for a guest is there a story that"],[[4,8],"stands out yes Hawaii was super the one"],[[4,11],"you mentioned with Dwayne was super"],[[4,12],"challenging because I went there and"],[[4,14],"they were in the process of promoting"],[[4,15],"Jumanji so they were really busy and"],[[4,17],"they had way more important things to do"],[[4,19],"and every two seconds like just wanted"],[[4,21],"to run this script by you ultimately"],[[4,23],"Kevin Hart was not able to do the collab"],[[4,25],"anymore this was five minutes before we"],[[4,28],"were supposed to shoot so my day-to-day"],[[4,29],"manager Kyle had to step in and act"],[[4,32],"alongside Dwayne five minutes before we"],[[4,34],"shot the video"],[[4,37],"Dwayne's friend who literally doesn't"],[[4,42],"act and we gave the script to 30 seconds"],[[4,44],"before he was sweating and dying to act"],[[4,46],"alongside do anybody killed it what are"],[[4,48],"the mechanics behind shooting with"],[[4,49],"Michelle Obama I imagine but the Secret"],[[4,51],"Service the time constrains there's some"],[[4,53],"moving parts right yeah it's so funny"],[[4,55],"shooting with Michelle such a huge honor"],[[4,57],"but obviously there's a lot of protocol"],[[5,0],"to follow you know I met her first in"],[[5,1],"the White House so I walk in and someone"],[[5,4],"came up to me think oh okay so you know"],[[5,7],"she's gonna come out and she's gonna"],[[5,9],"meet you right here and then they put a"],[[5,11],"marker on the ground of where she was"],[[5,13],"gonna meet me yeah and I said you can"],[[5,14],"take a selfie with this hand and I'm"],[[5,17],"like oh my god okay look this at what if"],[[5,18],"I go with this and they're like we"],[[5,19],"prefer this hand because of just the way"],[[5,21],"her hair is gonna be and I'm like okay"],[[5,23],"she comes out she doesn't hit the mark"],[[5,25],"she goes on the other side from me I'm"],[[5,27],"like so I literally look at the girl my"],[[5,30],"I'm like stressed so I take a picture"],[[5,33],"with the other head and I'm so scared"],[[5,34],"Lee to kick me out of the white house"],[[5,35],"but it's completely fine but yeah there"],[[5,36],"was a lot of mechanics in there yeah all"],[[5,44],"right Cheers okay cool one butterfly"],[[5,47],"bakery smoked onions so I understand"],[[6,8],"that as a kid you'd walk around with a"],[[6,9],"world wrestling championship belt as I"],[[6,12],"paid you you still do it"],[[6,13],"it's in the green room okay we got it"],[[6,16],"locked up for you and I've heard you"],[[6,19],"compare the WWE to Bollywood can you"],[[6,22],"unpackage that comparison a little bit"],[[6,24],"for us the thing I love the most about"],[[6,26],"the WWE's they've taken this really"],[[6,28],"intense sport and they've added such"],[[6,31],"wonderful dramatics to it and so when"],[[6,33],"you watch WWE"],[[6,35],"there's wrestling but the majority of it"],[[6,37],"is like trash talk"],[[6,38],"rip hey trash talk and like all this"],[[6,41],"drama and all this beef happening and"],[[6,43],"that's how Bollywood is Bollywood is all"],[[6,45],"about dramatics and all about theatrics"],[[6,46],"and I'm really drawn to things like that"],[[6,49],"cuz I'm so interested in how they can"],[[6,50],"hook an audience's attention I've been"],[[6,52],"to so many wrestling events and on"],[[6,54],"either side of me there's these huge"],[[6,55],"grown dudes they're like crying at the"],[[6,58],"results of a match that they know is"],[[7,1],"orchestrated but I was still crying"],[[7,3],"about it"],[[7,4],"I think that's magic truly mango okay"],[[7,9],"Cole smalls is in my DNA I should be"],[[7,11],"okay with this get a little hot in here"],[[7,17],"no I know what it is it's fine yeah"],[[7,21],"harness it I'm just kidding to make me"],[[7,23],"feel better"],[[7,24],"all right so besides your obvious charm"],[[7,26],"and charisma you've built this YouTube"],[[7,28],"legacy through your master of the art of"],[[7,31],"relatability I've heard you say that you"],[[7,34],"will pour over analytics read comments"],[[7,37],"and then you have this microprocessor in"],[[7,39],"your brain where you can do some quick"],[[7,40],"math and decide whether or not some"],[[7,42],"is relatable enough and wonder does that"],[[7,44],"get harder as you get older do you end"],[[7,47],"up like jay-z on Kingdom Come just"],[[7,49],"rapping about things no one can relate"],[[7,51],"to you know what no one has ever asked"],[[7,53],"me that question and I need to give you"],[[7,54],"props right now because that's such a"],[[7,56],"good question because that is absolutely"],[[7,58],"what happens I really pride myself on my"],[[8,0],"ability to be relatable now things that"],[[8,2],"happen in my everyday life annoying"],[[8,3],"people at the movies there's something I"],[[8,5],"argued with my parents things that"],[[8,6],"anyone watch and could be like yeah I"],[[8,8],"know what that feels like and then they"],[[8,9],"share with their friends but as my life"],[[8,11],"gets crazy and I make videos about oh I"],[[8,14],"hung out with Dwayne I go with the rock"],[[8,15],"always someone thought I was cool enough"],[[8,17],"to give me a private jet for the day I"],[[8,19],"understand that the average

2019\nhttp://www.detectivepikachumovie.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/detectivepik...\nhttps://twitter.com/DetPikachuMovie \nhttps://www.instagram.com/detectivepi...\n\nThe world of Pokémon comes to life!\n\nThe first-ever live-action Pokémon movie, “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” stars Ryan Reynolds as the titular character in the first-ever live-action movie based on the iconic face of the global Pokémon brand—one of the world’s most popular, multi-generation entertainment properties and most successful media franchises of all time.\n\nFans everywhere can now experience Pikachu on the big screen as never before, as a talking detective Pikachu, a Pokémon like no other. The film also showcases a wide array of beloved Pokémon characters, each with its own unique abilities and personality.\n\nThe story begins when ace private eye Harry Goodman goes mysteriously missing, prompting his 21-year-old son Tim to find out what happened. Aiding in the investigation is Harry’s former Pokémon partner, Detective Pikachu: a hilariously wise-cracking, adorable super-sleuth who is a puzzlement even to himself. Finding that they are uniquely equipped to communicate with one another, Tim and Pikachu join forces on a thrilling adventure to unravel the tangled mystery. Chasing clues together through the neon-lit streets of Ryme City—a sprawling, modern metropolis where humans and Pokémon live side by side in a hyper-realistic live-action world—they encounter a diverse cast of Pokémon characters and uncover a shocking plot that could destroy this peaceful co-existence and threaten the whole Pokémon universe.\n\n“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” also stars Justice Smith (“Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom”) as Tim; Kathryn Newton (“Lady Bird,” TV’s “Big Little Lies”) as Lucy, a junior reporter following her first big story; and Oscar nominee Ken Watanabe (“Godzilla,” “The Last Samurai”) as Lt. Yoshida.\n\nDirected by Rob Letterman (“Goosebumps,” “Monsters Vs. Aliens”), the “POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” creative filmmaking team includes two-time Oscar nominated director of photography John Mathieson (“The Phantom of the Opera,” “Gladiator”), production designer Nigel Phelps (“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Lies”) and Oscar-winning editor Mark Sanger (“Gravity”). Visual effects are by Moving Picture Company (“Wonder Woman”) and Framestore (“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2”).\n\nLaunched in 1996 to overwhelming response, the Pokémon brand is a global sensation that now encompasses a robust video gaming fandom with over 300 million units sold worldwide; the Pokémon Trading Card Game available in 11 languages with more than 23.6 billion cards shipped; an animated television series in its 21st season that is available in more than 160 countries; and over 20 animated films; as well as books, manga comics, music, toys, merchandise, and apps, including the wildly popular Pokémon GO, that has been downloaded over 850 million times and is enjoyed across the globe by fans of all ages.\n\n“POKÉMON Detective Pikachu” is set for release on Friday, May 10, 2019.\n\nThe film will be distributed outside of Japan and China by Warner Bros. Pictures, in Japan by Toho Company, Ltd. and by Legendary East in China.","views":45043467,"likes":1288226,"dislikes":60568,"channel_name":"Warner Bros.

for Abandoned Riddles","description":"I battle this Ninja Hacker to stop him from framing me!\n▶ Chad Wild Clay Marathon - https://goo.gl/FBJHCN\n▶ CWC Shirts & Backpacks - http://bit.ly/CHADmerch\n\nAfter Vy Qwaint made DECODE PROJECT ZORGO'S TOP SECRET LANGUAGE with SPY GADGETS (Mystery Evidence and Clues Found) and I, Chad Wild Clay, created PROJECT ZORGO MIXTURE In ABANDONED LABORATORY (Mystery Safe Found & Mysterious Escape Room Riddles), we found out the mixture B235 in real life can take my identity even further and escalate my wanted level. We found a treasure map that led us to the safe house and used spy gadgets to go inside before a PZ hacker member, who was searching for us, started to chase us and challenged us to a ninja battle royale. There was also a safe in the corner and we had to use clues and puzzles and decode them to get inside. We then made a decoy duplicate of the mixture using fun science experiments. Project Zorgo exposed us when they discovered we went into Joseph Banks' secret hidden laboratory. We ran into an abandoned desert and split up. CWC had the real mixture potion and Vy had a decoy. We think they're going to use this experiment to hypnotize us or clone us! Daniel & I found a hidden secret underground passageway tunnel and crawled through. We searched for clues and puzzles and mystery boxes. I hope they don't catch us and find out our safe house escape room location.

if we can find V should be"],[[5,38],"around this area it's like so silent out"],[[5,40],"here there's nobody out here I don't"],[[5,42],"think that's a good thing but she"],[[5,44],"definitely went

see"],[[6,21],"anything find that sign maybe there's"],[[6,23],"something sign it out yeah if you're"],[[6,26],"really great if V left a note on this"],[[6,28],"sign up here oh there's a map maybe

you could fill the stage shaking bro"],[[4,46],"like it was the stadium was coming down"],[[4,49],"like you know part of it for you Takashi"],[[4,52],"is that but that's what I'm getting here"],[[5,2],"take away from bro cool"],[[5,5],"y'all listen and it was on and this was"],[[5,7],"written in Forbes it said when I touched"],[[5,10],"that stage didn't matter of the Hat who"],[[5,12],"the hell I was"],[[5,13],"will not came on stage that felt like"],[[5,16],"the headland right there right it was"],[[5,19],"nothing else after that like yo Road"],[[5,21],"this is what I'm saying when I get on"],[[5,22],"stage I feel bad for ever goes on after"],[[5,28],"me in any circumstance take notes"],[[5,37],"because you could be doing these huge"],[[5,40],"stay driving on that one show in New"],[[5,45],"York"],[[5,45],"well now out of trouble you will be able"],[[5,49],"to do that what I respected about him he"],[[5,51],"was banned from the venue I snuck my she"],[[5,53],"snuck in"],[[5,54],"but he only snuck he didn't come with a"],[[5,56],"bunch of people came in one person"],[[5,58],"nothing you can't sneak in with a bunch"],[[6,0],"of people but the reason I respect him"],[[6,2],"is because when even when he snuck in he"],[[6,3],"was humbled the envy just well he said"],[[6,6],"whoever was hiding me in the corner it"],[[6,8],"wasn't me because I I don't know who him"],[[6,9],"but Jaime Mira show is gonna be a"],[[6,20],"disaster if six now was in there I think"],[[6,26],"it was because you know so crazy how"],[[6,29],"many times we go to pretentious and how"],[[6,31],"many time to go to the Barclays how many"],[[6,33],"times people go to MSG and it's like ah"],[[6,38],"everything car dealership we"],[[6,42],"who says that alum a yeah

bro"],[[6,56],"six none was needed in that place bro"],[[6,58],"Yoda the whole shit a little baby missus"],[[7,1],"like the baby man he on the project 23rd"],[[7,7],"but does it make you feel when you see a"],[[7,9],"venue like that in the reaction you get"],[[7,10],"is it make you feel like you need to"],[[7,11],"stop with the controversy so you'd be"],[[7,13],"less of a liability to you have to sneak"],[[7,16],"in you know what it is I don't think"],[[7,17],"this controversy I think I think I'm the"],[[7,20],"definition of of somebody actually doing"],[[7,23],"what they really want you know when"],[[7,25],"people want others be like I do what I"],[[7,27],"want I do what I want I do what I want"],[[7,30],"you really don't do you"],[[7,32],"I don't have no sensor like I

these do I need finish do"],[[0,2],"you think to be like I did it how about"],[[0,4],"five I like it like the way you think hi"],[[0,17],"everyone I'm Claire I'm back in the v8s"],[[0,19],"kitchen and today we are making gourmet"],[[0,22],"snowballs we took a little break but"],[[0,27],"we're back I've actually never had this"],[[0,29],"really classic hostess snack a snowball"],[[0,32],"but I'm excited to try it"],[[0,33],"our goal today is to recreate the pink"],[[0,35],"version these are coconut and"],[[0,37],"marshmallow covered chocolate cake with"],[[0,39],"creamy filling okay I don't want to be"],[[0,43],"overly confident but I think I think we"],[[0,47],"got this it has this really kind of"],[[0,49],"bouncy marshmallow coating it has a thin"],[[0,52],"layer of very small dried coconut and"],[[0,55],"then when you turn it over you can see"],[[0,57],"that the marshmallow coating doesn't go"],[[0,58],"all the way around the entire thing is 3"],[[1,2],"and 1/8 inches in diameter total it has"],[[1,6],"sort of a flat top so this is just the"],[[1,8],"marshmallow coating so it is like this"],[[1,10],"cloak sort of that goes over top of the"],[[1,14],"cake I think it's a little dry doesn't"],[[1,17],"taste like chocolate the cream filling I"],[[1,19],"basically think is the same as the"],[[1,22],"marshmallow on the outside but with less"],[[1,24],"gelatin so it's less set it's a little"],[[1,26],"bit more like spreadable the name yeah"],[[1,29],"snowballs if there was ever something"],[[1,32],"that I think you would like to be able"],[[1,33],"to nail yeah pretty I don't say easy go"],[[1,36],"- no I know but like you do this for fun"],[[1,38],"yeah there's something really fun about"],[[1,41],"like the bounce to the marshmallow"],[[1,43],"oh it's delightful I can't believe you"],[[1,45],"like this every time I think I know you"],[[1,47],"you really surprise me"],[[1,48],"the cake is also kind of dry right"],[[1,50],"because a dry track I don't like that"],[[1,53],"okay"],[[1,54],"the cream 2 in the middle is like almost"],[[1,56],"nothing right right right sugar the cake"],[[1,59],"has like no chocolate flavor really"],[[2,1],"there's a real drying quality"],[[2,4],"actually has a really nice yeah"],[[2,7],"it's dry right Brad was like I like"],[[2,9],"about it's dry but no one likes dry cake"],[[2,12],"nobody like strike right it really does"],[[2,15],"fit almost exactly into the bottom of"],[[2,18],"like a standard muffin tin so I think"],[[2,20],"I'm gonna use that devil's food cake"],[[2,22],"recipe for the chocolate cupcakes I did"],[[2,24],"okay stay tuned time for my favorite"],[[2,27],"part of every episode where I read the"],[[2,28],"ingredients ingredients water orange"],[[2,31],"sediment we deal our all right there in"],[[2,33],"sulfate or Regina tomorrow night right"],[[2,34],"look at hoping that high fructose corn"],[[2,36],"syrup contains two percent or less and"],[[2,38],"it is a long list shortening oh my gosh"],[[2,40],"how are our times"],[[2,44],"hey this is the longest word we've ever"],[[2,45],"seen carboxyl methyl cellulose all one"],[[2,50],"word mono calcium phosphate coatings"],[[2,52],"contained blue FD&C; Brio everyone"],[[2,55],"marmalade for alo 16 for my viola lively"],[[3,0],"that was a mouthful oh wait a minute how"],[[3,4],"hostess snowballs are made from"],[[3,5],"unwrapped Food Network I think we should"],[[3,7],"watch this no it's done fascinating so"],[[3,14],"the cakes are on the conveyor about as a"],[[3,16],"marshmallow is extruded in a sheet that"],[[3,19],"really covers the cupcakes like a"],[[3,21],"blanket so that that's a good that's an"],[[3,23],"interesting tip I'm gonna think about"],[[3,27],"this in its elemental part so first"],[[3,30],"we'll do the the cake and I'm gonna use"],[[3,33],"this devil's food cake recipe that I"],[[3,34],"developed a couple years ago we'll bake"],[[3,36],"it in the muffin tins"],[[3,37],"then there's the marshmallow I'm gonna"],[[3,39],"use the same base recipe for the outside"],[[3,41],"and the cream filling but I think the"],[[3,43],"cream filling will just have less"],[[3,44],"gelatin so it won't be as firm then the"],[[3,47],"third element is the coconut and I think"],[[3,48],"what I'll do is do you hydrate the"],[[3,49],"coconut overnight and then have some fun"],[[3,51],"with making a natural food coloring out"],[[3,54],"of beets"],[[3,56],"I'm gonna print out the devil's food"],[[3,59],"cake recipe and start there first I'm"],[[4,1],"gonna bloom my cocoa in espresso and hot"],[[4,4],"water and then I'm gonna put it together"],[[4,6],"with a method called reverse screaming"],[[4,8],"you start with all your dry ingredients"],[[4,9],"plus a portion of the fat and liquid"],[[4,11],"already in the bowl it just produces a"],[[4,13],"more level cake"],[[4,15],"then divided into my pan and bake it a"],[[4,19],"little tap all right so these stuck not"],[[4,26],"super successful next time I'll try to"],[[4,29],"do a more substantial layer of butter"],[[4,31],"and then a really nice generous flour"],[[4,33],"coating this is the hostess version our"],[[4,35],"version but overall I think it's a"],[[4,37],"really nice size and looks really really"],[[4,39],"close to the original great texture"],[[4,42],"looks like super tender it feels like a"],[[4,44],"very moist chocolate flavor I think I'm"],[[4,46],"gonna decrease the leavening a little"],[[4,48],"bit because to try to get it to settle"],[[4,50],"down a little right I'll do another"],[[4,51],"batch I also want to work on my coconut"],[[4,54],"mixture because I need the coconut"],[[4,56],"before I can put the marshmallow outside"],[[4,59],"together so I'm gonna be careful about"],[[5,5],"unmolding them this time"],[[5,8],"but there we go I think they look great"],[[5,10],"nice flat bottom / top food chocolate"],[[5,16],"flavor so I'll let these cool we'll rack"],[[5,18],"them up and save them tomorrow when we"],[[5,20],"come back time to open up these coconuts"],[[5,23],"so just really whack the hell out of it"],[[5,27],"all right well this one's pretty run"],[[5,30],"this is the problem with whole coconuts"],[[5,33],"especially like in the Northeast they're"],[[5,35],"usually pretty rotten you have to face"],[[5,40],"oh my god Chris"],[[5,47],"alright okay take two whoa okay that's a"],[[5,52],"pretty nice-looking coconut"],[[5,54],"I don't usually know what it is it's"],[[5,55],"like the coconut okay okay great"],[[5,58],"I see I see oh there we go okay great"],[[6,4],"all right well we'll be here for a few"],[[6,6],"minutes perfect put these in the"],[[6,9],"dehydrator in the meantime I want to get"],[[6,11],"my food dye going so here I have these"],[[6,13],"nice little beets"],[[6,14],"I'm going to just peel them and puree"],[[6,17],"them strain it reduce the liquid and"],[[6,18],"that's gonna be our food coloring the"],[[6,20],"cakes are at a good place the coconut is"],[[6,23],"dehydrating with the food colouring I"],[[6,25],"have to figure out how to dilute it I"],[[6,26],"was thinking maybe using vodka or"],[[6,28],"something that's not water-based because"],[[6,29],"I don't want to add moisture back to the"],[[6,31],"coconut after I've dehydrated it but I"],[[6,33],"think overall a pretty good day one oh"],[[6,37],"that is dry I kind of want to look at it"],[[6,40],"next - what are these called snowballs"],[[6,44],"again I get it think about it so I think"],[[6,52],"the size of the pieces actually looks"],[[6,54],"really really close tastes super"],[[6,58],"coconutty before I attempt the or Chanel"],[[7,1],"coating would be to work on the filling"],[[7,3],"we're trying to think back with Twinkies"],[[7,5],"how what we did with the filling and I"],[[7,6],"think for that we ended up with a"],[[7,8],"buttercream I'm gonna use a Swiss"],[[7,10],"meringue buttercream it's looking really"],[[7,12],"good and I feel like I'm getting a lot"],[[7,14],"in there oh my god"],[[7,17],"[Music]"],[[7,18],"let me look at this again so this is"],[[7,20],"marshmallow it's just so not delicious"],[[7,23],"Italian meringue buttercream which has a"],[[7,25],"sugar cook sugar syrup pour it into the"],[[7,28],"egg whites is very stable at room"],[[7,30],"temperature so maybe that's the best way"],[[7,31],"to go"],[[7,32],"[Music]"],[[7,38],"it's really good"],[[7,39],"obviously the homemade version is a lot"],[[7,41],"yellower because we added butter maybe I"],[[7,45],"want to move now to the coconut and try"],[[7,47],"to start getting that color right where"],[[7,51],"we don't were we talking about this yeah"],[[7,54],"it's really good"],[[7,55],"yeah Gillian Flynn wrote that she wrote"],[[7,58],"gone girl she with the novel anyway"],[[8,0],"sorry I lost focus the last time I use"],[[8,2],"this machine the only time I use it was"],[[8,10],"so this is that food coloring that we"],[[8,13],"made yeah yeah the compressor but then"],[[8,18],"we air it up with aged how you set the"],[[8,21],"PSI rear what does that mean okay so"],[[8,24],"that screws on yeah it does so now I"],[[8,29],"thought to bring anything I did it"],[[8,39],"through cheesecloth means to be finer"],[[8,41],"okay so let me get more let me get like"],[[8,43],"several layers of cheesecloth coffee"],[[8,48],"filter cool yeah okay clean this thing"],[[8,53],"your spray gun everybody knows that you"],[[8,56],"know just as important as purchasing"],[[8,58],"tools is maintaining this all be a"],[[9,1],"lesson learned"],[[9,2],"I'm add at this point everything about"],[[9,5],"me no this is to get out you can I mean"],[[9,8],"look I really kind of screwed it up"],[[9,9],"because there's all these little"],[[9,10],"sediment or sort of beep solids all"],[[9,13],"right red it's it's filtering should I"],[[9,15],"be mixing it with like alcohol or"],[[9,18],"something that's not water that won't"],[[9,19],"hydrate the ten this thing run out"],[[9,21],"probably probably liquid wouldn't it be"],[[9,24],"fun if we did like Malibu"],[[9,32],"that's right with the coconut oh it does"],[[9,35],"smell like coconut if anything you've"],[[9,37],"ever done well that works amazingly well"],[[9,40],"it was a lot of fun thanks for your help"],[[9,41],"it's time to fill the cakes so there's"],[[9,43],"about a scant teaspoon of the cream"],[[9,46],"honey weigh about a teaspoon of its"],[[9,49],"filling five grams gonna try and fill it"],[[9,51],"and hopefully get five to seven grams"],[[9,53],"the cake itself started to crack I think"],[[9,56],"maybe a better idea but to actually"],[[9,58],"physically create a little bit of a"],[[10,0],"space for the cream so I'm gonna use"],[[10,2],"this apple corer I know I know this has"],[[10,20],"butter in it so it's yellow nobody said"],[[10,22],"it had to be the right the same color"],[[10,23],"Oh clear piped butter and only butter"],[[10,29],"it's got great flavor good I don't feel"],[[10,32],"terribly beaten down because everything"],[[10,34],"is pretty much worked the way I want to"],[[10,35],"do too so that's great I do think that"],[[10,37],"in some ways like the hardest part is"],[[10,38],"gonna be the last part which is trying"],[[10,40],"to figure out a way to enroll the cakes"],[[10,42],"with the marshmallow my idea is"],[[10,44],"basically to type circles of the"],[[10,46],"marshmallow over top of the coconut and"],[[10,47],"then invert it over top of the cakes"],[[10,51],"this does more or less fit the cake that"],[[10,54],"we've made this one is really more like"],[[10,56],"10 centimeters and it's maybe stretched"],[[10,59],"out a little bit so I'm gonna shoot for"],[[11,0],"nine"],[[11,2],"so I have a marshmallow recipe that I've"],[[11,4],"used before that's from David Lebovitz"],[[11,6],"that uses egg white but also some light"],[[11,8],"corn syrup not high fructose and gelatin"],[[11,12],"and then I want to use just the back of"],[[11,15],"a spoon who try to spread it into one"],[[11,17],"even layer this is not really working"],[[11,19],"week try again okay that that maybe"],[[11,26],"worked let me go ahead and do the other"],[[11,27],"ones no I didn't really Center it that's"],[[11,50],"a freaking snowball five ever seen"],[[11,52],"Thanks"],[[11,52],"I think I'm gonna give him another"],[[11,53],"coating of a spray but it has to yeah"],[[12,2],"they'll set even more I'm gonna try one"],[[12,3],"more thing the problem is that the the"],[[12,7],"marshmallow is really set pretty firmly"],[[12,9],"so just as a Hail Mary with the"],[[12,12],"marshmallow I had left I piped"],[[12,13],"everything out over top of a layer of"],[[12,16],"coconut into this kind of rectangle and"],[[12,17],"so I'm going to try to basically just"],[[12,19],"punch out these circles and see if I can"],[[12,21],"cover the last few remaining pieces of"],[[12,23],"cake"],[[12,31],"they're ribbed you know at least we used"],[[12,33],"up the rest of the marshmallow and the"],[[12,36],"rest of the coconut so that's okay with"],[[12,37],"me"],[[12,37],"we're at a good place we're really close"],[[12,39],"I'm gonna throw some plastic on these"],[[12,40],"let them set overnight at room temp so"],[[12,43],"that tomorrow hopefully we get that same"],[[12,45],"kind of bounce on them on the"],[[12,46],"marshmallow and then Brad and I will hit"],[[12,48],"them with the airbrush again and then"],[[12,50],"we'll be ready to taste it's day three I"],[[12,54],"feel like we're basically done maybe"],[[12,56],"give them another coat of that food"],[[12,59],"coloring so there's that cream Center"],[[13,1],"that we piped in yesterday I'm happy to"],[[13,2],"see that it did not absorb into the cake"],[[13,4],"which is I guess something that happened"],[[13,6],"when we were working on the Twinkie"],[[13,7],"episode oh my god the cream like"],[[13,9],"disappeared it's gone it's really good I"],[[13,15],"think this is one of the best tasting"],[[13,16],"ones of the whole series you know what I"],[[13,21],"liked about it it's a little bit salty"],[[13,22],"from the buttercream on the inside but I"],[[13,24],"think we need a little more just uniform"],[[13,26],"pink color around the sides to get the"],[[13,28],"overall effect I'm gonna play around"],[[13,30],"with the airbrush gun because Brad kind"],[[13,32],"of hog did yesterday so oh yeah the hue"],[[13,38],"is actually even closer than I thought"],[[13,40],"it would be so I think that improved the"],[[13,43],"color a lot I think it's neat like that"],[[13,45],"we achieved that sort of unnatural"],[[13,46],"looking color but with totally natural"],[[13,48],"ingredients and no artificial food"],[[13,50],"coloring right amount of marshmallow"],[[13,55],"yeah it's quite nice cake is moist and"],[[13,58],"that great point I'm happy that the"],[[14,0],"filling is like nice and centered inside"],[[14,2],"did a great job thank you great job"],[[14,4],"Claire thanks Brad here we see can see I"],[[14,9],"just love that like you've got a cake"],[[14,10],"that like actually tastes like chocolate"],[[14,12],"mm-hmm there's a lot of cocoa in it I"],[[14,14],"only have to talk to you for one thing"],[[14,16],"you like yeah I agree with you so good"],[[14,23],"yeah it's just like perfectly moist"],[[14,26],"hours thanks way more delicious Thanks I"],[[14,30],"would it's like all things I like"],[[14,33],"chocolate cake buttercream marshmallow"],[[14,35],"coconut so what could what could be bad"],[[14,38],"all right so I can't say that snowballs"],[[14,41],"were like a nostalgic part of my"],[[14,42],"childhood but I had a lot of fun"],[[14,44],"recreating them"],[[14,45],"the parts came together relatively"],[[14,47],"easily and I'm super pleased about that"],[[14,49],"I also think of all of the treats in"],[[14,52],"this series that we've recreated this"],[[14,53],"might be in most ways like the most"],[[14,56],"delicious ones thanks for watching so"],[[14,58],"happy to be back and come back to the"],[[15,1],"next one here is how you make a gourmet"],[[15,5],"snowball to make the coconut coating"],[[15,8],"open to coconuts and use a coconut"],[[15,9],"grater to finally shred the white flesh"],[[15,11],"spread out

A new trailer, images and poster are now available. The trailer features Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, Finley Hobbins and Nico Parker.\n\nCircus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) enlists former star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) and his children Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins) to care for a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him a laughingstock in an already struggling circus. But when they discover that Dumbo can fly, the circus makes an incredible comeback, attracting persuasive entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), who recruits the peculiar pachyderm for his newest, larger-than-life entertainment venture, Dreamland. Dumbo soars to new heights alongside a charming and spectacular aerial artist, Colette Marchant (Eva Green), until Holt learns that beneath its shiny veneer, Dreamland is full of dark secrets.\n\nWebsite: https://disney.com/dumbo\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/disneymovietr...\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/DisneyDumbo/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/dumbo\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/dumbo/\n\nU.S. Release Date:  March 29, 2019\nCast:  Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, Alan Arkin, Finley Hobbins, Nico Parker.\nDirector:  Tim Burton\nProducers:  Justin Springer, Ehren Kruger, Katterli Frauenfelder, Derek Frey\nScreenplay by: Ehren Kruger\nExecutive Producer: Nigel Gostelow","views":7711642,"likes":161904,"dislikes":7853,"channel_name":"Walt Disney Studios","channel_id":"UCuaFvcY4MhZY3U43mMt1dYQ","day":3,"date":14,"month":10,"year":2018,"transcript":[[[0,1],"♪♪"],[[0,22],"Millie: Welcome baby Dumbo."],[[0,24],"We're all family here."],[[0,26],"No matter how small."],[[0,42],"♪♪"],[[0,49],"V.A.

simple"],[[0,42],"first you get a dollar you want to"],[[0,43],"insert it right over here and three -"],[[0,46],"whoa wait did you hit that bill I'll"],[[0,48],"give you three seconds 1 2 3 ding ding"],[[0,52],"ding all right let's do this now you'll"],[[0,54],"be notified whenever new videos out but"],[[0,55],"more importantly check this out"],[[0,58],"whoa you see that you see what's"],[[1,0],"happening on the other side what is that"],[[1,2],"what is that change up a little bit more"],[[1,10],"okay let's say you only have $20 but you"],[[1,13],"want to go to a concert that cost about"],[[1,16],"$100 how you gonna do that it's all"],[[1,18],"right here I'll contain and this little"],[[1,20],"contraption so same thing here got three"],[[1,24],"- well weights make sure you hit the"],[[1,26],"thumbs up because this is insane"],[[1,29],"alright let's get this video 27 likes"],[[1,31],"alright if we get it 27 I'm gonna give"],[[1,34],"every 100 let's see ah you know you'd"],[[1,45],"only have $100 but you want to get"],[[1,47],"yourself the new iPad pro which cost"],[[1,50],"$1000 okay we can turn this hundred and"],[[1,52],"to a $1,000 bill all right same concept"],[[1,56],"with this here here it is a thousand"],[[1,57],"dollar bill oh that's not good what do I"],[[2,0],"do"],[[2,0],"this is not a thousand can I just go"],[[2,1],"backwards no can I go forward I don't"],[[2,3],"have to do what do I do"],[[2,5],"all right"],[[2,6],"thousand dollars where's my"],[[2,8],"hundred-dollar bill down hello oh my"],[[2,12],"gosh alright well a dollar is cool so"],[[2,14],"always have a dollar today just move on"],[[2,16],"to the next gadget ah we're having way"],[[2,17],"too much fun with this one by itself so"],[[2,19],"on to the next so the next gadget is"],[[2,24],"called the money counter okay we're"],[[2,27],"through some cash before I got here"],[[2,28],"let's see how much this is in my wallet"],[[2,31],"put that in here $1.00 yes okay that"],[[2,37],"does sound right there you go like 20"],[[2,40],"dollar bills how much"],[[2,42],"okay there's 13 20s what's that equal to"],[[2,45],"oh I think it just counts it for you but"],[[2,50],"it doesn't really add it up for you so"],[[2,52],"13 times 20 let's do a little bit of"],[[2,55],"math here $2,000 thank you appreciate"],[[2,57],"let's do this one okay I have here some"],[[2,59],"fake money okay we got the supreme"],[[3,1],"dollars this is the one thousand dollar"],[[3,3],"bills right here let's see if it cuts"],[[3,5],"down okay"],[[3,7],"it really does detect if it's fake or"],[[3,10],"real that's good to know"],[[3,12],"that's good to know here we go have some"],[[3,13],"money here you go do it go oh all right"],[[3,21],"let's move on to the next gadget"],[[3,26],"okay next up we have our shelves seven"],[[3,28],"seven seven lucky jumbo slots okay it's"],[[3,31],"a slot machine but the cool thing about"],[[3,34],"this is it's portable it's tiny and you"],[[3,37],"can play it anywhere you want doesn't"],[[3,39],"need batteries out of the boxes can"],[[3,40],"already do whatever you want here so oh"],[[3,44],"so you do need batteries here okay"],[[3,49],"insult the battery is good to go so"],[[3,51],"technically this is a money bank or a"],[[3,54],"coin bank guys it's just a little fun"],[[3,56],"way to do it so I just put in coins here"],[[3,58],"that's your stash your bank here you can"],[[4,0],"put as many coins as you want and then"],[[4,1],"you kind of just move this and if you"],[[4,5],"get simmons like that you automatically"],[[4,7],"didn't jack the jack fly then all your"],[[4,9],"money's come out right here this which"],[[4,10],"is pretty awesome there's also a little"],[[4,12],"coin bank in the back no it's just the"],[[4,14],"cool like weightily earn your points"],[[4,16],"back for example if you want your coins"],[[4,17],"one day rather than smashing the piggy"],[[4,20],"bank you know you just pull the lever"],[[4,22],"okay if you don't win save it for"],[[4,26],"another day"],[[4,26],"let it go let it be what the next day"],[[4,28],"for example you can put some coins in"],[[4,30],"here and you spin it you don't want"],[[4,34],"again let it go that's how you save"],[[4,36],"money okay saving money let's say wait"],[[4,38],"from now you put like a lot more in"],[[4,40],"there okay spin it another day it's just"],[[4,45],"the perfect way to save money I got"],[[4,47],"really lucky the first time we saw 777s"],[[4,50],"that's how you win I must from now you"],[[4,51],"already saved up a month's worth of"],[[4,53],"coins rather than spending it like a"],[[4,54],"month ago it's all stashed up in here so"],[[4,57],"that way you have enough money to buy"],[[4,59],"whatever you want right now only if you"],[[5,1],"want this what you don't so let it go"],[[5,3],"let it go come back to it so let's say"],[[5,5],"two months from now this thing is like"],[[5,6],"fully filled and then you're like please"],[[5,8],"I need some going so I can go grab some"],[[5,11],"food spin it let it go if you're not a"],[[5,16],"winner it's not meant to be okay you say"],[[5,18],"a year from now okay you have to buy two"],[[5,19],"of these because this one's already felt"],[[5,21],"so you have to buy another one so you"],[[5,23],"spit this one I want my coins back it's"],[[5,28],"hot cool there's give me my coins back"],[[5,30],"this is why you never play slot machine"],[[5,32],"don't gamble everyone is really bad"],[[5,33],"coins"],[[5,35],"give me my clients I love my coins back"],[[5,37],"you think about this is like odds of"],[[5,40],"winning is really low you're just saving"],[[5,42],"the whole time take your coins go to"],[[5,51],"your favorite restaurant and have a good"],[[5,53],"time next gadget have you seen this one"],[[5,57],"this is called the money gun okay this"],[[5,59],"is supreme not really this is fake"],[[6,1],"supreme this is like $20 from Amazon and"],[[6,8],"then all you gotta do aim fire yeah do"],[[6,19],"it again so you want some cash I got you"],[[6,23],"ah the only bad part about this takes a"],[[6,28],"lot like an exit"],[[6,33],"all right this next one it's pretty cool"],[[6,36],"cuz this is a little robots and in"],[[6,38],"school they don't really teach you much"],[[6,39],"about financial stuff like taxes and"],[[6,41],"whatnot I introduce you to Katie well a"],[[6,44],"so it's a little robot that really gives"],[[6,47],"you financial advice okay little robot"],[[6,49],"for kids I don't know we're about to"],[[6,50],"figure out what it

pull like"],[[8,19],"quarters on top there's like a little"],[[8,21],"slit right there just whoa okay if I"],[[8,40],"were a kid and someone gave me this for"],[[8,42],"a present to save money I would be"],[[8,44],"saving money my entire life because this"],[[8,55],"[Music]"],[[9,5],"[Music]"],[[9,7],"spend wisely"],[[9,12],"apparently Katie can record noises so"],[[9,15],"listen yo yo how are you

today what a watch TV just calm"],[[0,14],"down"],[[0,16],"[Music]"],[[0,17],"breaking news okay but asteroid is"],[[0,21],"heading straight for Earth it could kill"],[[0,23],"all of us"],[[0,24],"here's astronaut Brooklyn t guy with a"],[[0,26],"statement hello everybody my name is"],[[0,28],"Brooklyn t guy I went to Wedgewood"],[[0,31],"middle school and now I'm an astronaut"],[[0,34],"for NASA how do you like that bitches"],[[0,36],"yeah I'm an astronaut how do you like"],[[0,38],"that mrs. Leibowitz my sixth grade"],[[0,40],"science teacher you said I wouldn't"],[[0,42],"become anything when I was playing with"],[[0,43],"my pencil pretending it was a spaceship"],[[0,45],"but now look at me I'm an astronaut what"],[[0,47],"are you doing you're probably dead"],[[0,48],"you'll hang anyway on a more serious"],[[0,52],"note there was a very large asteroid"],[[0,54],"headed toward Earth and it's very big"],[[0,56],"it's about the size of my ex-wife if you"],[[0,59],"haven't seen my ex-wife I really don't"],[[1,1],"know how you couldn't she"],[[1,2],"she is goddamn gigantic she's she's just"],[[1,5],"just fat so it's a very very large"],[[1,9],"asteroid if this asteroid actually hits"],[[1,11],"earth we will all die everyone on the"],[[1,13],"planet will be dead it'll be just like"],[[1,15],"the dinosaurs but but don't panic we"],[[1,17],"have a solution okay we're gonna launch"],[[1,19],"a nuke at the asteroid and one of four"],[[1,21],"things is going to happen okay the first"],[[1,23],"option is that it breaks up the asteroid"],[[1,25],"into millions of little pieces and they"],[[1,27],"burn up in the atmosphere the second"],[[1,29],"option is that it will break the S right"],[[1,31],"up into two medium-sized asteroids and"],[[1,33],"then we get DP'd and we're all dead the"],[[1,37],"third option is that the nuke does"],[[1,39],"absolutely nothing and we're all dead"],[[1,41],"and the fourth option is that we just"],[[1,44],"completely fuckin miss that the nuke"],[[1,46],"doesn't even hit the asteroid we shoot"],[[1,48],"it completely the wrong direction we"],[[1,50],"just we shoot the nuke with our eyes"],[[1,51],"closed we're not even looking we just"],[[1,53],"launched it so obviously we're hoping"],[[1,55],"for the first option and we're"],[[1,58],"broadcasting this live so let's go watch"],[[2,0],"this nope oh my god asteroid go check"],[[2,3],"your what are we gonna do I hope that"],[[2,4],"nuke stops it oh my god what's it"],[[2,6],"asteroid Danny is you're like a"],[[2,8],"hemorrhoid no chubby an asteroid is a"],[[2,10],"rock it's the earth we're all gonna die"],[[2,12],"can't believe this is actually happy I"],[[2,13],"don't believe it has to be a prank or"],[[2,15],"something this has to be a prank there's"],[[2,17],"no way that we're actually got a day we"],[[2,18],"might actually die today oh my god hurt"],[[2,22],"that bad Danny took it after it is much"],[[2,25],"bigger than just watch the TV and see if"],[[2,27],"they stopped it"],[[2,41],"okay so the nuke was a direct hit we hit"],[[2,44],"it perfectly right in the middle was a"],[[2,46],"bull's-eye beautiful shot"],[[2,47],"really nothing happened though"],[[2,49],"apparently this nuke was not big enough"],[[2,51],"to break up this giant asteroid so we"],[[2,54],"have no way to wipe this ass Troy out"],[[3,4],"we're all gonna die oh come on come on"],[[3,9],"that's funny we're not dead yet"],[[3,10],"all right but seriously we have no way"],[[3,12],"to wipe this ass I did it again I did it"],[[3,17],"I did it again"],[[3,18],"all right you guys are no fun so you can"],[[3,21],"start rioting and looting now because we"],[[3,23],"have no hope and I think we're all going"],[[3,25],"to die because we have no ideas so uh"],[[3,27],"goodbye right you oughta cool like you"],[[3,39],"know we're gonna be there ain't no one"],[[3,43],"gonna stops me it's a perfect time to"],[[3,45],"get a big TV a ps4 Xbox a boombox a lute"],[[3,50],"chain some fresh kicks why would you"],[[3,54],"need all that stuff we're gonna die"],[[3,55],"anyway cuz I can look flying heavy folk"],[[3,58],"but your made some stupid man for me"],[[4,0],"forget you fuck I'm gonna go Lou Right"],[[4,2],"see you later"],[[4,4],"it's gotta be an update or flipping all"],[[4,7],"right everyone we're here with dr."],[[4,8],"Frederick finger hits and he's supposed"],[[4,11],"to help us with this asteroid problem"],[[4,13],"figure shits no it's not finger shits it"],[[4,16],"is finger sheets I am NOT the Friedrich"],[[4,18],"Schinkel shit stinkin okay sycophants"],[[4,22],"not fickle not single shit Finkle shit"],[[4,25],"like like like tingle buzz with an F all"],[[4,28],"right tickle shits how about this"],[[4,29],"asteroid problem it's thinkin sheets"],[[4,32],"finish it it doesn't matter what your"],[[4,35],"name is freckle shits"],[[4,36],"just explore the asteroid problem it is"],[[4,38],"Finkle sheets for one and secondly I"],[[4,40],"have several"],[[4,41],"genius solutions to an asteroid problem"],[[4,44],"okay Jeanie solution number one we built"],[[4,47],"a shy"],[[4,48],"based on that and then we step up to the"],[[4,50],"plate and we knock the asteroid out of"],[[4,53],"the park"],[[4,53],"if you say we win all right fuck up"],[[4,56],"shits let me tell you the problem I have"],[[4,58],"with this that's a lot of wood for that"],[[5,0],"big of a baseball bat and we're on a"],[[5,2],"time crunch here freckle shits"],[[5,4],"mmm yes I see your point it that will"],[[5,7],"take another four then we are on a time"],[[5,9],"crunch so she is solution number two we"],[[5,12],"think a giant trampoline and then when"],[[5,15],"the asteroid comes to hit Earth it's the"],[[5,17],"trampoline and it bounces off back to"],[[5,19],"where it came from"],[[5,20],"yes yes they saved and this asteroid has"],[[5,23],"a very good time"],[[5,24],"all right what see that idea - shit ball"],[[5,27],"but the thing is is we're still running"],[[5,31],"out of time and that's a lot of material"],[[5,33],"to use huh yes okay good point good"],[[5,36],"point okay so genius solution no this is"],[[5,40],"a okay I say we propose a game of"],[[5,42],"rock-paper-scissors to the asteroid the"],[[5,46],"asteroid will obviously pick Rock"],[[5,47],"because it is made of rock and we pick"],[[5,49],"paper paper covers rock"],[[5,52],"and the asteroid goes home loser loser"],[[5,55],"I don't think that's a good idea there"],[[5,57],"Frankie shit because I don't think that"],[[5,59],"Freud wants to play rock paper scissors"],[[6,2],"from good and even if it did that's a"],[[6,4],"big-ass piece of paper where are we"],[[6,6],"gonna get all the paper we're gonna run"],[[6,8],"into the exact same problem as the"],[[6,10],"baseball bat oh yes I see your point"],[[6,12],"you're right"],[[6,13],"and I'm going out to my knees and"],[[6,16],"crayons well you couldn't make like a"],[[6,19],"like a shrink-ray for the asteroid hmm a"],[[6,22],"shape Hey yes I could make a shimmery"],[[6,30],"freckle shins did we lose them well"],[[6,34],"let's hope he can make a shrink-ray for"],[[6,36],"the asteroid okay good we can still"],[[6,38],"survive all the slides nothing to do is"],[[6,40],"shoot the meteor with this shrink ray"],[[6,41],"you know shrink it down really small and"],[[6,43],"they were all survived there's still a"],[[6,44],"chance there's still a chance to survive"],[[6,46],"there's still a chance yeah"],[[6,52],"today check I've got a pretty Rock look"],[[6,54],"for big rocks"],[[6,59],"[Music]"],[[7,1],"good doctor fredric pebble shits has"],[[7,5],"done he has made the shrink ray shrimp"],[[7,40],"ray we said shrink ray what to make"],[[7,43],"smaller oh oh you wanted a shrink ray I"],[[7,49],"thought you said they shrink ray I"],[[7,51],"thought you wanted me to turn the"],[[7,53],"asteroid into a shrimp well why the fuck"],[[7,56],"would we want that"],[[7,57],"I don't know I was kind of questioning"],[[7,59],"it myself really but but I did it I made"],[[8,2],"it should pray and yes but is it shrimp"],[[8,4],"now what well can you make a shrink ray"],[[8,7],"no no that is impossible what do you"],[[8,9],"think this is some kind of current tool"],[[8,12],"see it appears that we are having some"],[[8,15],"technical difficulties anyway we now"],[[8,17],"have astronaut Brooklyn T guy to explain"],[[8,21],"to us this new trim problem hey there so"],[[8,24],"you remember that asteroid that was"],[[8,26],"gonna slam into the earth and kill us"],[[8,27],"all well it's now been transformed into"],[[8,29],"a giant shrimp that's gonna slam into"],[[8,31],"the earth and kill us all so we're not"],[[8,33],"really sure how the asteroid get turned"],[[8,35],"into a giant shrimp but that is now the"],[[8,37],"problem and if that shrimp collides with"],[[8,39],"the earth we will all die especially"],[[8,41],"those of us who are allergic to"],[[8,43],"shellfish like like myself so if you"],[[8,46],"have any ideas on how we can solve this"],[[8,48],"shrimp problem please please give us a"],[[8,51],"call what a giant shrimp I know one"],[[8,55],"person who can fix this"],[[9,5],"you get your shrimp penis ballerina oh"],[[9,9],"yes

right"],[[9,52],"[Music]"],[[9,53],"breaking news good NASA has found a"],[[9,57],"solution to the giant shrimp"],[[9,59],"here's astronaut Brooklyn tea guy from"],[[10,1],"NASA okay everybody we finally have a"],[[10,3],"solution for a giant shrimp problem"],[[10,5],"Woody from Toy Story here Oh my booty"],[[10,12],"yeah yeah he has a solution for how"],[[10,15],"we're gonna fix this what do you so now"],[[10,17],"this is what we're gonna do they're"],[[10,19],"gonna put me in a rocky ship and then"],[[10,21],"their own laps me off into the outer"],[[10,23],"space"],[[10,24],"yeehaw yes

Comment, like, share this story.\n\nBuddy never really liked his parents, and they never truly got along. They argued and disagreed and butted heads over almost everything. They didn't see eye-to-eye on politics, to religion, to lifestyle and how to raise good healthy happy kids. \n\nBuddy is an atheist, while his parents are very devout Muslims. Buddy is very liberal, while his parents are very conservative. And, Buddy is also unapologetically gay, while his parents, not surprisingly, are extremely homophobic. \n\nBut, even though on the inside it was really clear that he didn't get along with his parents, he was never very public or vocal about his disagreements with his parents.He still needed a roof over his head, and food to eat, and money in his pocket, and he was afraid that if he shared who he really was and what he really believed too strongly they would kick him out of the house, maybe even disown him. \n\nBecause of that, he formed what looked like a good relationship with his parents, but it was totally fake and artificial - on the inside, he just didn't get along with them. They saw him as being practically perfect, a good and trustworthy kid, but Buddy saw that his parents were really flawed.\n\nHis mom liked to hold grudges, was very quick to judge people, and liked to enforce really old fashioned gender roles, like boys should do yard work and take out the trash and that girls only belonged in the kitchen and were destined to become subservient housewives. And his father was so invested and distracted by his work that he never formed and real bonds with his children.\n\nHe was also upset at the way his four sisters were treated. His parents wouldn't allow his sisters to have any friends over. They weren't allowed to have phones, or do any extra curricular activities, or drive once they reached the age where they could legally get their licenses.\n\nAnd it was even worse with Buddy, especially when he tried to come out to them and tell them he was gay - twice. The first time, his parents begged him to date girls because they saw his coming out as a real threat to them. The second time he tried they just threw out a slew of insults and homophobic falsehoods ranging from the idea that gay people were in fact mentally ill, to the idea that it was a simple choice and he was just making the wrong one. They threatened to disown him and told him he would be a failure in life unless he \"fixed himself.\"\n\nThis all made him so unhappy and he imagined that he would be under the control of his parents for the rest of his life. So, he felt he had to continue to pretend to be the perfect little straight Muslim boy in the house, dating girls and praying and the rest. He didn't think much of it, had been doing it pretty much his whole life, but when he finally confided in his friends they saw it for what it was, miserable and very, very unhealthy. They asked him to imagine what he would be and how he would feel if he was far enough away from them that they couldn't watch his every move, and judge and control him.\n\nThat was a turning point for him and, realizing his parents were more like prison guards than anything else, he thought of the farthest place he could go without them having a negative impact on him and still be successful and thrive as a young gay man.\n\nAfter doing a little bit of research he concluded that California would be the best place for him -- a thriving LGBT community, a ton of diversity and acceptance, and on the other side of the country from his toxic family life and parents. So, he applied to a few schools in California and, was accepted to attend UCLA! It was one of the happiest moments of his life.\n\nHis parents were hesitant about it at first, because of how far away it was, but they were happy to have him go to such a highly acclaimed school - that's mostly what they cared about.\n\nSince moving to Los Angeles Buddy has never been happier. He is part of a really diverse community with amazing friends, endless support, and a great education. Even though he returns home on Holidays and has to pretend, just like he used to, he is so happy to be out of that toxic house and on his own.\n\nHis next wish is for his sisters, that they will recognize the truth about their parents, follow in his footsteps, and escape!\n\n- - -\n\nWhat's your story?  storybooth wants to hear it!

200 why now Aaron"],[[9,13],"that was a pretty decent effort what do"],[[9,14],"you only do differently this time"],[[9,16],"anything down the center of the pitch"],[[9,17],"would be good maybe just a little less"],[[9,20],"but now to be fair Stanford it wasn't a"],[[9,23],"bad first effort I was pretty close"],[[9,24],"alright if it does the same thing that I"],[[9,26],"might give you a chance in
