Verbal Irony
Jane Austen's storyteller and characters regularly say a certain something and mean something unique - they utilize verbal incongruity. The following are a few precedents from the content. By every case of verbal incongruity, clarify the speaker's actual importance.


What They Said
	What They Meant
"It is a reality all around recognized, that a solitary man possessing a favorable luck must be in need of a spouse."


* Narrator
This is a case of verbal incongruity on the grounds that not every single rich man need to get hitched. A few men despite what might be expected, wish to remain single with the end goal to evade the issues that accompany a relationship. They would likewise need to be subject to themselves and not accommodate others monetarily.
"I am superbly persuaded… that Mr. Darcy has no deformity."


* Elizabeth (while nursing Jane at Netherfield)
This shows verbal incongruity since Mr. Darcy's identity contains numerous characteristics, for example, gaudiness, that others would by and large think to harm their character subsequently sorting it as an imperfection. By having Elizabeth say this, Austen makes a snide tone that jabs fun at Mr. Darcy's liberal persona.
"He giggles, and grins, and has intercourse to every one of us. I am massively pleased with him."


* Mr. Bennet (to Caroline about Wickham)
This would be verbal incongruity since it is intended to influence Mr.Wickham to appear to be a pleasant individual to everyone. In any case,
Mr. Bennet is truly saying that Mr. Wickham is circling from young lady to young lady and not showing good characteristics.
"However, I trust that I should date [my love for Darcy] from my first observing his delightful grounds at Pemberley."


* Elizabeth (to Jane)
This is a case of verbal incongruity in light of the fact that in the start of the novel, Elizabeth makes a decision about ladies for wedding for cash, for example, her companion Charlotte Lucas. Be that as it may, now she will date Darcy in the wake of seeing his vast domain. This demonstrates she is negating her convictions by following the generalization of ladies wedding for riches and a high societal position.

Directing Question: In what ways does the content feature or investigate customary sexual orientation jobs?


Key Quote
	Analysis
"When she is secure of him, there will be relaxation for becoming hopelessly enamored as much as she chuses" (Austen 23).
Wedding a man is the main route for a lady to guarantee their fortune amid the Victorian ages. In spite of the fact that this appears to be exceptionally chauvinist, amid that day and age ladies had little openings for work consequently a man's riches is the on option for a ladies' fortune.


 
"'Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I conveyed what needs be exceptionally well quite recently, when I was prodding Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton'" (Austen 25)?
This statement is noteworthy on the grounds that it underpins the possibility of conventional sexual orientation jobs amid the Victorian age and past that. It is frequently trusted that ladies bother other men with the end goal to get the consideration of the men they need.
"A mind-blowing matter was to her girls hitched; it's comfort was visiting and news" (Austen 7).
This statement outlines the job of a mother in the Victorian period, which is to discover a spouse for their little girls with the end goal to get a monetarily steady life for them. Austen chose to incorporate this statement since it indicates how ladies had almost no function chances to accommodate themselves so they needed to depend on their spouses fiscally.
"I could scarcely keep my face exceptionally counter-intuitive to come by any stretch of the imagination! For what reason must she be hurrying about the nation since her sister had a chilly? Her hair so messy, so blowsy" (Austen 36)!
This statement speaks to sex jobs in light of the fact that in customary society, ladies needed to stress over their excellence and appearance with the end goal to interest men. At the point when Elizabeth comes to Netherfield, the Bingley sisters demonstrate the perspectives of conventional ladies and how they judge each other as though wedding a man is a challenge. Austen adds this with the end goal to demonstrate how ladies needed to satisfy exclusive requirements in light of the fact that the main way a lady is fruitful is through marriage.
"A woman's creative energy is extremely quick; it bounces from reverence to love to marriage in a minute" (Austen 28).
In this statement, it is stating that ladies bounce into connections quick without giving it a chance to create at an appropriate pace. They additionally have this dream like picture of how marriage and love ought to be. The creator included this statement on the grounds that amid this era, ladies and men got hitched inside a limited ability to focus time. For the most part, because of cash being included or having the capacity to acquire a specific rank or place in a family.
"A lady must have an exhaustive learning of music, singing, drawing, moving, and present day dialects, to merit the world" (Austen 39).
Ladies had particular jobs in the public eye that had little training and work. For instance, appeared through the statement, ladies are customarily expected to be amusement to draw in men. This difficulties sexual orientation jobs since Austen records these errands that demonstrate no genuine significance to society with the end goal to indicate incongruity.
"'Be that as it may, if a lady is inclined toward a man, and does not try to hide it, he should discover it out'" (Austen 23).
Sexual orientation jobs are unmistakably appeared through this statement as it is a typical conviction that ladies appreciate playing a round of 'feline and mouse' to engage a suitor.
"I am not sentimental you know. I never was. I ask just an agreeable home; and thinking about Mr. Collins' character, associations, and circumstance throughout everyday life, I am persuaded that my shot of joy with him is as reasonable, as the vast majority can brag on entering the marriage state" (Austen 123).
Charlotte Lucas pursues sexual orientation jobs by wedding men for their societal position and riches. This fits sexual orientation jobs on the grounds that most ladies wed to please men since they care most about their social class. Despite the fact that Elizabeth repudiates this thought by dismissing Mr. Collins, Charlotte trusts that she will be upbeat by wedding him in spite of scarcely knowing him and demonstrating no fascination towards him.
"'My explanations behind wedding are, first, that I think it a correct thing for each minister in simple conditions (such as myself) to set the case of marriage in his area. Also, that I am persuaded it will add extraordinarily to my satisfaction'" (Austen 103).
This backings sexual orientation jobs in light of the fact that well off men wed for bliss. This additionally bolsters the main sentence of the novel since it guarantees that men with fortune are in the need of a spouse. Mr. Collins fortune is that of heavenliness and what he thinks about a directing rule for wedding a young ladies.

"'Be that as it may, I reveal to you what, Miss Lizzy, on the off chance that you bring it into your make a beeline for continue declining each offer of marriage along these lines, you will never get a spouse by any stretch of the imagination and I am certain I don't know who is to keep up you when your dad is dead'" (Austen 111).
This shows how Elizabeth needs a spouse soon before her dad bites the dust since then shes will have no methods for being fiscally bolstered. This additionally demonstrates how ladies have practically zero function openings so they need to depend on their significant other for cash.
" That it is regular with young women to dismiss the addresses of the man whom they furtively mean to acknowledge when the main applies for his support"
(Austen 104)
This statement implies that men imagine that if a lady is stating no to them, they extremely mean yes or that they are endeavoring to be legitimate. Mr. Collins does not accept her reaction as dismissal, but rather her endeavoring to be legitimate as lady.
